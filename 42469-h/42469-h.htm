<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>When the reader is familiar with the writer&#8217;s general
purposes, it is easier to understand the details of
his work. This book is intended to deal with houses in a
housekeeping spirit. In doing this, the architect has in mind
convenience, stability, and that ideal of housekeepers, beauty
of surroundings.</p>

<p>In carrying out this idea, the relation of architecture to
good and economical housekeeping is first considered. Following
this division is &#8220;A Journey through the House.&#8221; It begins
at the porch, moves through the different rooms, and stops to
consider the various details. This brings about not only
a consideration of the general arrangement of a house, but such
details as kitchens and pantries, plumbing, laundry, and
heating.</p>

<p>These first two sections of the book&mdash;&#8220;The Architect and
the Housewife,&#8221; and &#8220;A Journey through the House&#8221;&mdash;are, in
a measure, educational. After this, and in keeping with the
general principles that have been set forth, plans of fifty convenient
houses are illustrated and described. For the most part,
they are houses that have been built.</p>

<p>The next section is devoted to practical house-building.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
It is constructed by taking a complete specification for everything
which may concern a dwelling-house, and ridding it, as
far as possible, of all technicalities; thus putting in form all
practical house-building questions for the benefit of the owner.</p>

<p>Following this is the consideration of business points in
building, which sets forth methods of letting contracts with
the view of securing the best results without waste of money.</p>

<p>The closing section is devoted to the getting of a home,&mdash;how
to arrange the monthly-payment schemes, building-association
plans, and other methods for getting a house on
easy instalments.</p>

AND GOOD CONSTRUCTION.&mdash;COMPACT HOUSES NOT NECESSARILY

<p>There is a definite relation between the work of the housekeeper
and that of the architect. This is the text of this
book. It is a part of the business of the architect to do what
he can to make housekeeping easy. He can do a great deal.
He should understand the principles and practice of good housekeeping.
This knowledge is something which cannot be derived
from the architectural schools or offices; it must come from a
home. The public press of the country has had a great deal
to say about the artistic qualities of domestic architecture, a
great deal to say about house decoration, and, altogether, has
furnished much valuable matter. Little, however, has been
said as to the relation of architecture to good housekeeping.
The artistic element should not be neglected. There must also
be considered the question of convenient arrangement, economy
and ease, for the housekeeper.</p>

<p>Washing dishes is disagreeable work, but the architect can
do his part toward making it easier. If we take a conglomerate
mass of china, knives, forks, and spoons, pots, pans, and kettles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and bring them together on one small kitchen table, which has a
dish-pan on one end and a wooden water-bucket at the back, with
a scarcity of everything to facilitate the progress of the work, we
have a condition quite different from that wherein there is a roomy
sink with a table on each side of it, and plenty of hot and cold
water above. An architect may plan a kitchen so that all of these
conveniences are possible. He may plan it so they are impossible.</p>

<p>The floor-plan of a house has a definite relation to house
keeping requirements, which is not fully appreciated. The
difference between a good floor-plan and a poor one may make
the difference of three or four tons of coal in the heating of
a house during the winter. It may influence the keeping of a
servant, the wages to be paid, or may control the necessity for
one or more than one. It makes more difference to a man who
lives in a house that costs two thousand dollars or three thousand
dollars, as to whether he burns seven or ten tons of coal
in warming it, than it does to the man who lives in a ten-thousand-dollar
or twelve-thousand-dollar house as to whether he
burns fourteen or twenty tons. The cost of fuel is of more
importance to a man of moderate means than to one of wealth.
Then in the matter of service: it is difficult to keep a good servant
in a bad kitchen, or in a badly planned house where there is a
vast amount of sweeping and other work to be done every day.
Those who plan factories and mills arrange them with reference
to the saving of labor. The idea in saving labor is to save money.</p>

<p>One can build a better house for a given sum of money at
this time than ever before. The real reason for this is to be
found outside the fact that material and labor are cheaper now
than they have been in the past. It is because of the thought
that is put into the planning and arranging of dwellings. It is
the thought that saves the money. It adds external and internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
attractiveness, convenience, labor-saving devices, and arrangements.
Thought helps to make housekeeping easier.</p>

<p>Economical housekeeping can be most readily carried on in
a compact house. To say that a house is compact does not
necessarily imply that it is crowded, or that any of the conditions
of comfort are neglected. If we avoid waste space, such as is
frequently assigned to large halls and passages, we merely take
away something that is not needed.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that a man and his wife go through
life with the hope of building a better house "some day." They
are economical; they live carefully; they live in a small house;
they are crowded. At last, by dint of hard work and careful
management, enough money is accumulated to build the new
home. This is the great event which has been thought about
for so many years.</p>

<p>The idea in building this house is invariably to get something
as different from the old house as possible. It was square; the
new building must be irregular. It had no front hall; the new
house must have a large one. There were no grates in any of
the rooms; in the new house there must be one in each. In
the old building the rooms were very small; in the new house
they must be very large. There was no porch before; now
there must be one running across the front and along one side
of the house. Altogether, the idea of the old house and that
of the new are in direct opposition to each other. In one
instance they were crowded; in the other they have plenty of
room. There can be no doubt about the abundance of room.</p>

<p>The building is finished; they move into it. Almost the
first person to leave it is the servant whom they had in the old
house. She sees the amount of work which she will have to do.
It was easy enough to sweep the old house, with its small, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>pact
plan. Housekeeping was relatively a small matter; but
with the habits of economy, which rendered the new home possible,
they will not employ additional help. The work which is
left over by the servant falls to the mistress. Strange as it may
appear under such circumstances, it takes the mistress a long
time to find the cause of the trouble. It is the house. It
was planned with an entire disregard for the work which was to
be done. It had not been thought of. The idea was merely
to get something which was different from the disagreeable
features of the old home. They thought that everything would
be easier and pleasanter and more agreeable in every way. The
only trouble with the old home was that they were too much
crowded. In the new they are not, but have an impossible
amount of work to do every day. The difference between what
they wish to do and what is done, is represented by fretfulness
in addition to the natural weariness at the end of the day.</p>

<p>What has this to do with architecture and economical house-building?
Simply this. The house which is economically
planned is economical as to money, carpets, sweeping, and
strength. The architect may do a great deal for housekeepers
by keeping this thought in mind.</p>

<p>To recur to the idea of economical house-building in a direct
sense, it may be borne in mind that economy and good construction
go hand in hand; that none of the conditions of permanency
are sacrificed for the sake of cheapness. Of two
houses which cost the same, one may be far more convenient
and roomy by an avoidance of waste space and unnecessary
material. Evidently one flue-stack will cost less than four.
Therefore, if a house can be constructed which has only one
flue-stack, it will cost less than one which has four; but the
demands of the housekeeper, and those who live in the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
are that the one stack afford the conveniences of four. People
do not like compromises in house-building, especially when they
are building a home. The compromises come easier when one is
planning property for rental. Evidently a house in which one-fifth
of the floor space is given up to halls is more expensive than
one which contains a smaller proportion of such space. According
as one is able to diminish the amount of passage room, and
yet meet all of the conditions of good and economical house-keeping,
he can reduce the cost of the house as to its building,
its furnishing, and the amount of labor required in caring for it.
Thus economy in construction, and convenience and ease in
general housekeeping movements, go hand in hand. Parallel
illustrations might be carried forward, so as to include each
detail of the house.</p>

<p>The architect may do a great deal for the housekeeper by
making his mouldings and interior wood-work so that they will
not catch dust, and can be readily cleaned. Some of our friends,
who have studied the artistic qualities of house-building to the
exclusion of all other considerations, will say that a regard for
housekeeping requirements, in the matter of interior decorations
and construction, is placing too great a limit upon their work.
They will say that beauty and general artistic qualities are not
always consonant with the means which will make easy housekeeping,&mdash;that
they are limited by such considerations. This
need not be so; it is simply a question of ingenuity and thoughtfulness.
One may be careless of utility, and make very beautiful
things. Another may be thoughtful and careful as to housekeeping
requirements, and design something quite as beautiful
and attractive as the former.</p>

<p>In the above statements will be found the guiding principles
which affect all of the work of this book.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>HOUSEKEEPING OPERATIONS.&mdash;THE WORK OF THE HOUSEKEEPER.&mdash;THE
AVERAGE HOUSEWORK OF A WEEK.&mdash;THE ARCHITECT&#8217;S
LESSON THEREFROM.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>With the architect a house has been too often considered
as something to be looked at. No one is disposed to
criticise an architect for making houses pretty and attractive.
It is true, however, that many houses are nothing more than
pretty; they are not convenient. They are not built with a
regard to the requirements of housekeeping. A lady once said
to the writer, that an architect would never live up to his opportunities
until he had associated himself with a housekeeper,
who would be strong enough, in her control over him, to see
that the housekeeping conditions and conveniences were kept
constantly in mind.</p>

<p>In order fully to reach the housekeeping idea, it will be convenient
to consider in detail what is meant by housekeeping.
Primarily, a house is a place in which to eat and sleep. The
present requirements of comfort and luxury suggest that all
should not eat and sleep in the same room. Originally this was
the case. The primitive man needed only a hut or a cave, or
the protection of a rude shed. Later on, he was satisfied with
a hut with one or two rooms. If the weather was cold, the
occupants would huddle around the fire, and eat and sleep
without regard to other surroundings. A bath in cold weather
was unnecessary. During the summer this was regarded more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
as a matter of recreation than of necessity. A neighboring
stream served the purpose of more modern arrangements.
Housekeeping operations under such conditions were light
indeed.</p>

<p>There are many homes of this kind in America to-day.
If we take the case of our Indians, we find that the squaws
have time for much else than the absolute duties of camp-life
and the care of children. There is much other labor which falls
to their lot, house-work being regarded, as it is, insignificant.
This is one extreme. There are various gradations which come
with the instincts of a higher civilization. Education, and other
conditions which go with it, increase housekeeping requirements,
and thus far have not furnished to the majority compensating
conditions in labor-saving devices. At the present time, the
natural and affected requirements of housekeeping make the
life of many a woman one of the extremest drudgery and hardship.
Her condition is almost that of a slave; and this at a
time when she is surrounded by many of the elements of
a higher civilization. Her children and those around her frequently
live under the shadow of her uncomfortable condition.
The Indian&#8217;s home, in the rest and peace which it affords, is often
preferable. This condition is brought about by the increasing
requirements upon the housekeeper, without the presence of
other compensating conditions.</p>

<p>Assuming that an architect may do something to make
the care of a house lighter, it remains to call attention to
the modern requirements of a housekeeper, with a view of simplifying
her work. Let us watch her work for a week; we will
begin on Monday morning during the month of January, and
assume that there is one servant in the house to help,&mdash;bearing
in mind, at the same time, that it often happens that the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which is here outlined is done by the housekeeper herself, with
possibly only the help of a wash-woman. First, the house is to
be warmed, the kitchen fire to be kindled, the living-rooms
to be swept and dusted, the washing to be started, the children
to be dressed, breakfast to be cooked and put on the table, and,
in many cases, all of this done before seven o&#8217;clock. The
serving of breakfast is no small task to the housekeeper. The
coffee is to be poured, food prepared for the children, and many
other things done which no man can specify. As soon as
breakfast is over the men are out of the house, but not usually
before making more than one demand upon the time of the
housekeeper. Then the dishes are to be washed, and the children
made ready and started to school. Next, the grocery and
butcher supplies must be cared for. Possibly they are ordered
from the boy who calls at the door. In some instances a trip
for this purpose is required. Next, the dining-room must be
arranged, the dishes put in place, the chamber-work attended
to, beds made, children&#8217;s things put away, sweeping done, slops
disposed of, fires looked after. Some time or in some way the
clothes worn by the children on Sunday must be especially
looked after, stitches taken, a little darn here and there, and then
put away. During this time there may be the demands of one
or more babies to be met. In this there is no compromise.</p>

<p>With the completion of other work dinner time is approaching,
for, with the majority, this is a noon meal. The cooking
must be done, and yet nothing else must be allowed to lag.
The children in their confusion are home from school. Then
dinner. Every one is in a hurry to get away. The children are
sure they are going to be late. There is more work for them
and the men, and then they are gone. Dinner dishes are
washed, and the laundry work continues. The afternoon is little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
different from the morning; there is a little less rush and confusion,
but a continuance of regular work. Before supper the
evening supply of fuel must be provided. In the mean time
the children are home from school with their demands. Now
supper must be in mind. Where there are children in the house,
this is one of the most trying times of the day. They are tired,
hungry, and sleepy. Supper is over. The children go to bed
at intervals during the evening. The men have a place by
the fire. The housekeeper often feels it incumbent upon her to
mend, darn, or sew, if no heavier work presents itself.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning calls for a repetition of the former day&#8217;s
work, with ironing substituted for washing. There is the carrying-out
of ashes and the bringing-in of coal, and the same routine
during the day. On the part of the housekeeper regular sewing-work
is taken up as opportunity presents, and possibly calls are
made or received. Wednesday, the same. Thursday, the servant,
if one is kept, is out for the afternoon. Other regular
work must progress. Compromises are not thought of. Friday
is general sweeping-day, in which everything is thoroughly gone
over. The housekeeper must find time to go down street one
or more times during the week, for the purpose of doing necessary
shopping. Saturday brings its scrubbing and cleaning.
During the week must come the window-washing, cleaning of
silver, baking, and many things besides.</p>

<p>Sunday is often the hardest day of all; the children require
especial care. There is church in the morning, Sunday school
in the afternoon, and, in many cases, church at night. In the
mean while the children are on hand all the time. Where is
the man who will say that his business life is as exacting or as
harassing as the work which is here outlined?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>In the pages which follow it is the intention to bear
the housekeeper and her requirements in mind, and to
suggest what is properly due her in the way of labor-saving
devices, with a view to facilitate the manifold operations of
housekeeping.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>MODERN CONVENIENCES.&mdash;A LITTLE HISTORY.&mdash;PLANS THAT MAKE
EXTRA WORK.&mdash;MODERN CONVENIENCES ENUMERATED.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the conveniences of housekeeping are modern.
It is only within the past few years that the demands of
the housekeeper for helps or aids in making her work easier
were thought worth considering. Even now we occasionally
meet men who think that anything that was good enough for
their mothers is good enough for their wives. We have in mind
a farmer who, during fifteen years, purchased three large farms.
He buried a wife for every farm. Their death was the result of
more than slavish work. The disposition which leads in this
direction often continues after the time when economy does not
demand close living.</p>

<p>The man who moves west to a new country cannot pay for
many of the modern conveniences. The demand for them is
not great. Such a man usually builds a house of two or three
rooms. The family cook and eat in the kitchen; they sit there
between meals. The other rooms are for beds. There is not a
great deal of house-work to be done in a house of this kind.
The trouble comes when the pioneer becomes wealthier, and
builds a large house "in town" or on the farm. Possibly his
wife or daughters do the work as they did in the smaller house.
If not, it is done by one servant. The work in this house is a
great deal harder. There is a great deal more of it than there
was in the two or three room house, which was built during their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
earlier life. In the former house, if they had coffee, it was poured
from the pot in which it was made directly into the cups which
were on the table. The meat was taken from the skillet in which
it was cooked and put into the plates of those who ate it. If
they had pancakes, the wife would sit with her back near the
stove, where she could easily reach the griddle to grease it and
turn the cakes while she was eating her meal. There was no
formal dessert. The pie was eaten from the same plates as the
rest of the food. There were no napkins; often, no tablecloth.</p>

<p>It did not take long to wash the dishes after a meal of this
kind&mdash;there were not many of them. In from fifteen to twenty-five
minutes after the meal was over, the wife could be seen
sitting by the kitchen stove, sewing or knitting. The pans and
the kettles were out of the way, and the kitchen was turned into
a sitting-room. If the weather was cold, the door into the bedroom
was open; the whole house was warm and comfortable.
Wood was plenty and cheap.</p>

<p>This woman&#8217;s troubles began when her husband, by dint of
hard work and close economy, found himself in a position to
gratify his pride in his accumulated wealth by building a new
house. It was a big white house with green blinds. The stories
were twelve or thirteen feet high; a large hall ran through the
centre; the kitchen had nothing in it but doors and windows
and a stove-hole; there was no sink, no conveniences of any
kind. They now had a separate dining and sitting room, and
an awful parlor with brussels carpet on it, which had red and
green flowers all over it. The bedrooms were upstairs. They
were all large; wood-work painted white. In the winter they
were cold. The old habits of economy which made this house
possible had so fixed themselves upon the occupants that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
would not build a fire in the bedrooms. They said that
they &#8220;didn&#8217;t think it healthy to sleep in a warm room.&#8221;</p>

<p>People go to see Mrs. Green in her new house. They go
through and look at it, and say, &#8220;Oh, how nice.&#8221; But they find
a tired woman. She doesn&#8217;t sit down to sew or knit in a few
minutes after the meal is over, as she used to. She is at work
all the time. The children must have clothes to fit the house.
There is more sweeping and dusting to do; there are more
dishes to wash; there is more of everything to do. Still, she
came into the new house expecting to find things different and
easier than they were before.</p>

<p>The modern conveniences are those arrangements and appliances
which make it possible for people to live comfortably in a
larger house, without seriously increasing the cares which they
had in a smaller one. In the old house of two or three rooms
the mother would bathe the children once a week in a tub by the
kitchen fire. The tub would be dragged out the door, which
was not very high above the ground, and the water emptied into
the yard. In the new house it is different. The water is
carried from the pump in the back yard, and from the kitchen
stove, upstairs into one of the rooms. Then it has to be carried
down again, emptied into the alley or the yard. The living
habits are all changed without the compensating conveniences
which naturally belong to them. It is probable that Mrs. Green
keeps a &#8220;girl,&#8221; but even then she has infinitely more work to
do than ever belonged to the old home. She cannot understand
it. She has a new house and a girl, and yet she is
always tired.</p>

<p>Most of the houses in the newer cities and towns are, in a
measure, similar to this. Nearly every one attempts to live up
to the mark set by those who have all of the appliances of mod<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ern
housekeeping. Coal and water have to be carried all over
the house. Slops and ashes have to be carried downstairs and
out of the building.</p>

<p>By attracting attention to the inconveniences of housekeeping,
we may see and understand the full meaning of the term
&#8220;modern conveniences.&#8221; There is a natural call for dish-washing
arrangements to take the place of the square table, with the dish-pan,
the tea-kettle, and the water-bucket. In its place, we have
at one side of the kitchen, a sink, with cocks for hot and cold
water immediately over it. The tables and drain-board are
arranged to simplify the operations of dish-washing. The water,
instead of being carried to the yard or alley, finds its way
naturally into the drain through the sink. Modern laundry
arrangements make it unnecessary to carry great tubs of water
outside, or to delay wash-day on account of the weather, or to
bring in the frozen clothes during the cold winter days. The
bath-room, with the tub, the water-closet, and the wash-stand,
is on the second floor. This saves a great deal of work. The
water does not have to be carried upstairs nor the slops down.
There is hot and cold water within easy reach of all the rooms.
Often it happens that there are stationary wash-stands in the
various bedrooms, though this is only usual in the most expensive
houses.</p>

<p>The amount of work which a furnace saves is not readily
estimated. It also saves money. Others of the modern conveniences
are &#8220;places to put things;&#8221; large closets in the bedrooms,
well supplied with drawers, shelves, and hooks; a
general closet on the upper floor, which is accessible from all of
the rooms, for bedding and other articles of common use; a ventilated
closet in the bath-room, in which soiled linen may be put
without contaminating the atmosphere. There should be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
closet or place on the second floor for brooms, dust-pans, and
dusters. Where there is no particular place for these articles,
the housekeeper or the servant has to use time in searching, or
in going up and down stairs. Anything which saves labor may
be regarded as a modern convenience.</p>

<p>No one ever heard of the matter of house-planning being
discussed in a convention of architects. Their reports will
show that a great many subjects are handled, but none so near
home as this. Sometimes there is an effort to discover that
America has a style of architecture peculiar to itself. When such
a thing becomes true, the effort to find it will not be necessary.
An American architecture will have its growth in American
necessities, and not through the blind copying of foreign styles
and architecture. Nor to have an American style does it necessarily
mean that we should ignore foreign precedent. It means
that we should consider foreign architecture intelligently. Everything
that is good should be adopted, no matter whence it
comes. Those of us who see what is going on in the architectural
world frequently notice English houses designed and built
for those who live in the cold Northwest. In many of them the
broad, English casement windows and general style of architecture,
which is suited to the gloomy light and the mild temperature
of Great Britain, is placed in the bright, cold climate of the
Northwest. Nothing could be more out of place; it is an affectation,
an exhibition of bad taste and poor sense. The cold
Northwest, with its bright, clear atmosphere, presents its own
architectural conditions. The work of blind copyists, those who
have so strong a regard for precedent, is ridiculous. In one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the Eastern magazines there was an illustration showing what
purported to be an old colonial cottage, situated possibly at
Newport. The architect had copied the old colonial details, the
old colonial forms, which were very nice, but he had also copied
an idea which had its outgrowth in extreme poverty. He had
placed a rain barrel at the side of the house, and had set it up
on a rustic-looking bench or support, all of which was very
ridiculous. This had been done in an old colonial house, and
had its origin in old colonial poverty. Now, this architect, in his
respect for that which was past, copied the faults, the inconveniences,
and arrangements which belonged to those earlier times.
A course of this kind, carried out to its fullest extent, would lead
us to barbarism. In the same magazine was another house
which was designed with great respect for precedent. In it was
a front door which was divided about half-way up, so that the
lower part might be shut and the upper part opened. Houses
have been seen where something of this kind was reasonable,
where it had its advantages. There are many places in this
country where a door of this kind is almost a necessity; but it
isn&#8217;t on the seashore. If one has a house in the country, or in a
small country town, where the horses and pigs, geese, chickens,
and other animals, are allowed to roam about in the front yards,
a door of this kind has its uses. In the summer time the upper
part can be thrown back and the lower part closed, so that the
most a horse can do in the way of getting into the house is
to stick his head over the top rail and look in. In the country
mills doors of this kind have a very proper and apt name;
they are called pig-doors. They keep the pigs off the mill floor,
and, at the same time, allow the light and air to come from
above. But there is no necessity for a pig-door at Newport or
Long Branch, or other seaside resort. Their use is a silly affec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>tation.
There is no beauty in them. There is no convenience
which would lead to their use.</p>

<p>It is performances such as the above which retard the natural
development of American architecture. American architecture
will be simply carrying out, in an architectural way, the requirements
of the American people in their buildings. From their
homes the march of progress will be through the kitchens,
pantries, and dining-rooms. It will unite with the parlor and
sitting-room ideas, which have been more clearly worked out.
The exterior will be formed in a natural way by the requirements
of the interior, and by the variations of climate, and it will be
decorated in a rational, artistic manner. We will not hamper
the interior by the adoption of doors and windows which possibly
belonged in a cathedral of the twelfth or thirteenth century,
or the richer details of the later time, which had their special
uses and forms as the development of the necessity and requirements
of that particular period. The doors and windows of
the nineteenth century should have their own special forms and
positions. They should be decorated with a true regard for
precedent so long as precedent does not influence the arrangements
suited to modern times. The American style of architecture
will not be developed through grand public buildings
and enormous cathedrals, or expensive dwellings.</p>

<p>In this country every one is imbued with the idea of having
a home of his own, and he desires to have it nice, convenient,
and attractive. The average home is in a small, inexpensive
house. The proper construction of these buildings, their arrangement
with reference to their housekeeping requirements,
their tasteful external designs considered in a rational way, will
develop American architecture. It will be the expression of
American wants in a natural, artistic spirit.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>JOURNEY THROUGH THE HOUSE.&mdash;PORCH.&mdash;VESTIBULE.&mdash;HALL.&mdash;LONG
HALLS AND SQUARE HALLS.&mdash;THE HALL THAT IS A
ROOM.&mdash;RECEPTION HALL.&mdash;PARLOR.&mdash;SITTING-ROOM.&mdash;DINING-ROOM.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>In this section of the book we will make a journey through the
house, stopping at various points of interest long enough
to give general consideration to the details. From the principles
herein derived, the plans subsequently given are constructed.</p>

<p>Every house should have a front porch. It should be wide,&mdash;if
possible, eight feet, that one may sit at a distance from the
railing and afford a space for others to pass behind. The porch
is a protection to the front part of the house from the sun, wind,
and, partially, from the cold. Nothing can be pleasanter than
to sit on a shady porch during the warm part of the day or in
the evening. It is an auxiliary to the vestibule.</p>

<p>The front door should be wide&mdash;three or three and a half
feet. Double doors look very nice from the outside, but they
are not as convenient or as easily handled as the single door.
The door-bell should be at the right-hand side. The threshold
should be elevated from three to six and a half inches above the
porch floor.</p>

<h4>VESTIBULE.</h4>

<p>In the plans that are given, various arrangements of vestibules
are shown. In a few instances, direct entrances into the
hall and reception-room are indicated, but such an entrance is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
not as desirable as where there is a vestibule. The arrangement
of a vestibule for hat-rack, umbrella-stand, and other conveniences,
changes the hall into an available room. Take, for
instance, plan <a href="#Plan_16">No. 16</a>, page 153. At the right, as one enters, is
a little closet; in it are hooks. At one side is an umbrella-stand;
on the floor is a place for overshoes. Here one may
arrange himself before going into the hall or reception-room.
This is altogether better than having to pass across to one side
of the hall or room, in order to find a place to deposit overshoes,
wraps, umbrellas, etc. It saves work. If this vestibule
have a hard-wood floor, and on it is placed a rug, one may
stand there and divest himself of that which he would not carry
into the house, and go into the room in good order, leaving the
muddy overshoes, and the possible dampness of his umbrella
and overcoat, behind him. This arrangement saves work; mud
is not carried into the room. It is a very simple matter to
care for the vestibule; the rug on the floor may be taken to
the outside, and the deposit of mud and dust readily removed.
It is well to have a small mirror at the side, or in the rack.
The plan mentioned is merely suggestive, and does not apply
to all houses. By looking through the plans given, various
arrangements may be seen. In some of them there is no
vestibule. Not all housekeepers want the same arrangement.
Again, others do not care to pay for a vestibule. In other instances,
the hall is too small to admit of one. As said before,
a good vestibule changes the hall into a room. It makes a
reception-hall tolerable, because it is not necessary to deposit
there many things which should have another location. A vestibule
does not properly serve its purpose where there is no
room or arrangement for depositing wraps, etc. The closet part
of the vestibule, shown in the cut, can, perhaps, be omitted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
hooks arranged around the wall sides. A curtain could be hung
across the space occupied by the closet door: however, all these
details are matters of taste and disposition. In the opening
between the hall and vestibule may be placed tapestry curtains;
these are sufficient storm protectors from the outside door,
especially if the hall register is placed near it. No one who
has not tried it, can realize the amount of protection from the
weather that is afforded by a heavy curtain. It is not necessary
or desirable that a door be placed in the opening from the
vestibule to the hall.</p>

<h4>HALL.</h4>

<p>This part of the house may be hall, reception-hall, or room.
It is a hall or passage frequently, and not provided with a vestibule.
It may be a hall from its shape; it may be a room for the
same reason. It may be of no use as a room, if the stairway is
improperly placed. The house arranged with a long, narrow
hall, having the stairway at the side, is essentially wasteful of
room. Such hall space is usually dark and gloomy as well as
crowded. A hall eight feet wide and twenty feet long, contains
one hundred and sixty square feet of floor-surface, though only
a limited portion of it is available, on account of the shape of
the space which remains after the stairway is placed. A hall
twelve by thirteen feet contains one hundred and fifty-six square
feet, but a great deal more available room. The space not occupied
by the stairway is in better shape. A hall of this shape
partakes of the nature of a room, and may be used as such. In
the plan referred to a window-seat is shown. This window-seat
may be used as a seat in warm weather, and, if the front is in
the proper direction, as a conservatory in the winter. There are
many such arrangements as this shown in the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>The hall, in most of the plans, is a key to the whole arrangement.
It has been a common, objectionable practice during the
past few years to build houses of moderate cost, so that the hall is
along one side with its entrance to the front, and the parlor next
to it; back of the parlor is the sitting-room, and the hall opens
into the dining-room; back of the dining-room is the kitchen,
and so on to the extreme rear with summer-kitchen, pantry, etc.
This makes a long house with only one room in front on the
first floor, and one chamber and alcove facing the street on the
second. Thus the hall serves only as a passage-way. The living-room
has no front view. To obviate this, the halls in the plans,
that are considered with most favor, are arranged to be used as
rooms, and the vestibules are built so that such a thing is possible.
If the hall is to be used as a vestibule, the hat-rack and
other arrangements for hanging wraps, and the umbrella-stand,
etc., are placed as near the front as possible. Where this is not
done there must necessarily be a track from the front to the
back, as a mark of travel.</p>

<p>The stairway may start at one side, and should lead towards
the centre of the house. The nearer it can be started to the
rear of the hall, the better; this gives more room in front.
Sometimes the stairway is started immediately in the rear of the
reception-hall, or from an alcove space at one side; these are
good arrangements, depending, of course, upon other conditions.
Upon one side, or in the rear, should be placed a grate. Nothing
can be pleasanter when coming in from a disagreeable outside
than an open-grate fire; this needs no argument. Under
the stairway, or in some convenient nook, it is well to have a
lavatory. The hall should be arranged as a centre from which
to pass to the parlor, living-room, and dining-room. It is important
to consider in this connection that the hall, and the stair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>way
in it, should be placed so that the stair-landing above is in
the centre of the house. Thus we have in the centre of the
building only a small hall as a starting-point; hence less waste
room. When the stairway lands near the front wall on the
second floor, a passage must be provided to the rear of the
house. Where the landing is in the centre, we have only to
pass into rooms without extra steps through long halls. For
example, see plan No. 1, page 110.</p>

<p>Not every one cares to use the front hall as a reception-room.
There is certainly no objection to naming and using it
otherwise.</p>

<h4>RECEPTION-HALL, PARLOR, AND SITTING-ROOM.</h4>

<p>During recent years there is more of a disposition to live all
over the house; one reason for this is the improved heating
arrangements. The terms sitting-room, parlor, reception-room,
mean less in a distinctive sense, and are used largely for the
purpose of classification. We will consider the parlor and the
sitting-room in the same connection. The parlor has lost the
awful stiffness of times past. It is now a reception-room.</p>

<p>In a house where there is a reception-hall in front, and
the sitting-room to one side, both having a distinct front view,
as is shown in many of the plans, a lady may occupy the front
room and have her children and work around her, if desirable.
A caller may be received in the reception-room; these, however,
are matters of individual preference. The vestibule may be
planned so that it will have an entrance to both reception-room
and sitting-room.</p>

<p>In some instances the arrangement of sitting-room and
reception-hall are reversed. The hall is the sitting-room, and
the other room the parlor. If doors are used between hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and sitting-room, they should be sliding; the effect is better, and
the separation of the rooms as complete as necessary. Such
doors should always be hung from the top. The sitting-room
should certainly be as good a room as any in the house; as well
located. There should be a closet on the first floor, and, if
possible, it should communicate with this room; if not that,
with the dining-room or reception-hall next to it. Certainly the
sitting-room should always be provided with a grate.</p>

<p>A window-seat in the hall, parlor, reception, or other room,
is really a great addition in more ways than one. It is not only
attractive, but it adds to the availability of a room. Where there
is space for three or four people to sit, in case of necessity, it
is like seating that number of people outside of the room.
They are comfortable, and the room has that much added to its
seating capacity. A bay window arranged in this way is pleasant
indeed.</p>

<p>Wall space is of great importance in these rooms. In planning
a house, the piano, pictures, lounges, book-shelves, book-cases,
bric-à-brac, etc., should be in mind. In a house of moderate
size, it is, ordinarily, not necessary that the reception-hall,
parlor, or sitting-room should be wider than thirteen and a half
feet, and from fifteen to eighteen feet in length. However, this
is not wide enough for those who entertain largely. A room
thirteen and a half feet, with much furniture in it, is not wide
enough for dancing.</p>

<p>A house arranged with a reception-hall, parlor, sitting-room,
dining-room, etc., is used when it is desired to entertain a great
deal; but for those who are living economically, whose means
are limited, one of these rooms may be omitted. In many of the
modern houses the number of rooms on the first floor has been
decreased and their size increased. Oftentimes there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
reception-hall, a small library, and a dining-room only, as
belonging to the living part of the house on the first floor.
An arrangement of this kind belongs more particularly to a
house which is occupied during only a part of the year; say as
summer cottages in the North, and winter houses in the South.
Modern ways of living make a larger number of rooms less
desirable.</p>

<p>When it is possible, it is pleasant to have a little room off
from the library as a study, or for a doctor as a reception-room
or office. Where one does work at home, it is advantageous
to have a private room that insures isolation, be it never so
small. Often the library, so called in an ordinary sense, is not
a library at all. There may be a few books in it, but it is used
as a sitting-room or passage, and has no distinct necessity or
use.</p>

<p>Additional rooms require more work than the same amount
of floor space in a less number of rooms. The addition of
rooms multiplies corners, windows, doors, etc., and adds more
cost and labor, than does mere additional space. The availability
of a room is not always dependent upon its size. A good
deal depends upon the arrangement of wall space. A room may
be large and still have no room for the furniture that is to go
into it. It may be small and still have room enough.</p>

<h4>DINING-ROOM.</h4>

<p>A good width for a dining-room is thirteen feet. Where
one can afford it, it should be from fifteen to twenty feet in
length; larger than this is a luxury. Its location, for the most
part, is back of the sitting-room or hall. A grate in the dining-room
is not altogether desirable; it is always at somebody&#8217;s
back. Again, a grate does not heat a room uniformly. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
very common to provide sliding-doors to connect the dining-room
with other parts of the house, even with the parlor; but
they are not the best kind to use. Sound and the odors of the
food are more readily communicated through sliding-doors than
others. For that reason they should not be used. A large,
single door, three and a half feet wide, is preferable, though it
does not always give the desired opening. Generally speaking,
it is easier to provide wall space when planning a dining-room
than in any of the other rooms in the house. A large number
of windows is not necessary, and one of them can be placed
high, and thus afford space for a sideboard. This sideboard
should be placed at the end of the room nearest the entrance to
the kitchen and china-closet, where such is used. The sideboard
has various uses, according to the plans of the housekeeper. In
some cases it is merely a place to display dainty china and other
table furniture. Below are places for linen and table cutlery.
In other cases, the sideboard is used as a buffet; as a place
from which to serve the food. Sometimes this is carried to the
extremest degree, and includes the carving, and the serving of
that which goes with the meats.</p>

<p>It was very common in times past to use a slide connecting
kitchen and dining-room. A passage is much better. The
slide is worse than a door in communicating sounds and odors.
In some of the plans in this book, doors are shown opening
directly into the kitchen. This is done under protest; the
owner of the house would have it so. The sideboard may be
built as a part of the house. This is well enough when the
question of cost is not important.</p>

<p>From the dining-room we will pass to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The kitchen existed in its state of greatest cleanliness and
order a good many years ago in New England, where it
was largely used as a sitting and dining room. As people became
more prosperous, they moved out of the kitchen; they had a
separate sitting-room. It was then that the kitchen began to
decline. After this it was often literally as well as figuratively
separated from the living part of the house.</p>

<p>The public has not suffered through lack of information on
cookery and general housekeeping topics. Little has been said,
however, about the house itself, with regard to its arrangements
for facilitating the manifold operations of housekeeping. The
subject is a broad one, and may be treated with some respect to
detail. As the heart of the house, the kitchen may be given
serious consideration.</p>

<p>In the modern house the kitchen is merely the place where
the food is prepared for the table. The controlling idea and its
arrangements should be to afford facilities for doing the work
with as little labor as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>The kitchen is the workshop of the house. It should be
arranged and planned according to the same general principles
as any other workshop. A manufacturer arranges his foundry,
his mill, or his printing-house, with reference to the saving of
labor, for the purpose of saving money. When we save labor
in a kitchen, we save the energy of the housekeeper, and,
possibly, money.</p>

<p>An article on this subject was probably never written that
did not pretend to describe the &#8220;model kitchen.&#8221; It is safe to
say that no such kitchen was regarded as &#8220;model&#8221; by all readers.
A model kitchen is something which is out of reason. No
two housekeepers have the same requirements. Housekeeping
practice varies greatly. Again, the kitchen that can be built to
one floor-plan cannot be built to another. In describing a
kitchen, it is in mind to set forth certain general principles for
the benefit of those interested.</p>

<p>There is little difference between the requirements of a
kitchen for a house of moderate cost and an expensive house.
Work of the same general character is done in every kitchen.
The conveniences are more a matter of thought than of money.
Elaborate details add much to the cost, but little to the convenience.
There is little or no difference between the cost of a
well-planned kitchen and one which is poorly planned.</p>

<p>To state the case broadly, a kitchen should be arranged
solely with reference to the work which is to be done in it: the
cooking, dish-washing, the care of the kitchen itself, and possibly
the laundry work. This latter work should be removed from
the kitchen&mdash;in any event, the washing should be done elsewhere&mdash;when
it is at all possible. The steam and odor from
the washing, which not only fill the kitchen but permeate the
house, are enough to render whatever food there is in the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
unfit for use. It is altogether possible to arrange in the cellar
of any house that is being built, and in many that are already
built, at a trifling cost, a laundry in which the washing and ironing
may be comfortably done. Of course this does not contemplate
set tubs; but set tubs are not found in houses where the
washing and ironing are done in the kitchen, and it is possible
to do this work both well and easily without their use. There
is little or no objection to doing the ironing in a well-ventilated
kitchen. It is clean work, and while doing it the servant may
attend to any cooking which is necessary, and see that the other
work of the house moves forward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 523px;">
<a id="Fig_2" name="Fig_2"></a>
<img src="images/fig_2.png" width="523" height="600" alt="Fig. 2" title="Fig. 2" />
</div>

<p>The kitchen the plan of which is here given (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>) has
been in use for three years under the varying conditions of one
or two servants, and at times none at all. These are the condi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>tions
under which most housekeepers operate. There have
been no emergencies in which the kitchen and pantries have not
proven themselves ample, and none in which the housekeeper
thought that they were too large and complicated. It is as
necessary in houses where the means for maintenance is simply
moderate, that a kitchen should not be too large as that it
should afford ample facilities for accomplishing any work which
may be done.</p>

<p>The kitchen itself is thirteen and one-half by fourteen and
one-half feet. In it are placed the range, tables, sink, drain-board,
etc., and the kitchen safe. The room has been found
large enough for the work which is to be done there, and not so
large that the tables, range, and safe are so far apart that time
and strength are wasted moving from one to another. The
kitchen has one large window in it, which is three feet from the
floor. This permits the placing of a table, ironing-board, or
chair under it, and thus gives additional wall space. There are
two windows in the pantry, and a draught is secured through
them, the kitchen window, and the transom over the door. The
door is glazed.</p>

<p>The most disagreeable work of a kitchen, and that which
takes much time, is the dish-washing. It is possible to make
this work lighter and pleasanter than is usual. The necessary
conditions are plenty of water, hot and cold, a place where the
dishes will drain themselves, an abundance of table room for
them both before and after washing. In the kitchen given the
sink is placed next the kitchen flue. This gives a place for
the pipe duct next the warm bricks, which prevent freezing
even in severe cold weather. During the three years in which
this kitchen has been in use they have never frozen, even when
the temperature was twenty degrees below zero. The exact con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>struction
of this kitchen pipe-duct and other kitchen wood-work
is given elsewhere. The range, which is usually next the flue,
is, in this instance, placed at some distance from it. There
is no reason why this should not be done, as it has been in
many instances, with no disagreeable results.</p>

<p>The sink is not enclosed, but stands upon legs. Enclosed
sinks are places which cannot be kept clean even with the
utmost vigilance. The brushes, scrub-rags, and buckets, which
are usually kept there, are in this kitchen provided a place
elsewhere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<a id="Fig_3" name="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/fig_3.png" width="379" height="400" alt="Fig. 3" title="Fig. 3" />
</div>

<p>At the left of the sink is a table; at the right, a drain-board,
which is inclined toward the sink, and provided with grooves.
At the right of this is a swing-table on the same level. The
soiled dishes are placed on the table at the left, washed in the
sink, which is provided with cocks for hot and cold water,
drained on the drain-board, and, when wiped, placed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
table at the right. A glance at the plan will show that they are
then beside the door which leads to the china-closet, and may
be quickly placed where they belong.</p>

<p>It may be well to say a few words about the china-closet.
The shelves are placed in a passage which leads from the
kitchen to the dining-room, and are separated from the passage
by doors. This passage is lighted by a window, and has two
doors leading into it&mdash;one from the dining-room, and one from
the kitchen (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>). These doors are swung on double swinging
hinges, so that they may be opened by merely pushing against
them, and will then swing back noiselessly into a closed position.
One may pass through doors of this kind with a tray full of
dishes without touching them with the hand. This arrangement
dispenses with the necessity for a slide, and also does away with
the noises and odors from the kitchen, which so readily find their
way to the rest of the house where a slide is used. However,
if a slide is really desired, it can be placed over either the table
at the left of the sink or over the swing-table at the right, and
be convenient from both kitchen and dining-room.</p>

<p>The china-pantry could be readily enlarged into a butler&#8217;s
pantry, by extending it across the end of the dining-room, and
placing the end window of this room on one side, thus bringing
two windows on the same wall. There is a movable shelf under
one of the permanent shelves in this china-closet, which can be
drawn out in order to place a tray of dishes on it while they are
being put away, and which can be pushed out of the way when
not in use. This shelf is also of service as a place upon which
to arrange the different dishes needed for the several courses of
a meal, and in this way facilitates the table service.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, the combination idea is carried out in pantry and
china-closet. The pantry-cupboard projects into the room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
a way to form a partition between the pantry and china-closet,
and, at the same time, admits of a passage between the kitchen
and dining-room with a separation of two doors.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a> indicates an approved form of construction of china-closet
and pantry, such as may be used in most of the pantries
and china-rooms which are in this book.</p>

<p>The work which takes the most time is the preparation of food,
and every well-planned kitchen has its arrangements for lightening
this burden. The first consideration is the location of the
utensils, and the table and sink where the meats and vegetables
are prepared. All should be near enough to the range so that
there are no unnecessary steps to be taken. The number that
are taken where the sink is in one corner of the kitchen, the
table in another, and the range removed from both, is innumerable.
In this kitchen the table proper and the sink are together,
and they are but a step from the range.</p>

<p>There is a small swing-table attached to the wall at one side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of the range. This provides a place for utensils, such as spoons,
and forks, and dishes, such as those holding pancake batter,
which are in constant use during cooking, and which cannot be
held in the hand while the cooking is in progress. This alone
saves many steps. The drain-board is a good place for draining
vegetables, and to place utensils which are used in the preparation
of food. Above the sink are hooks, etc., upon which to
keep small utensils. In localities where there is much dust
coming in from the outside these utensils must be kept elsewhere,
behind closed doors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_5" name="Fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/fig_5.png" width="500" height="352" alt="Fig. 5" title="Fig. 5" />
</div>

<p>For the preparation of bread, cake, pastries, etc., the pantry
is provided. In it are places for everything which can be used
for such preparation. One can go out of the heat and noise of
the kitchen into a little room which holds everything that can
possibly be needed, and there prepare those articles of food
which take the most time and careful attention. In <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a> are
two windows; under one is the dough-board. This is a table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
fastened to the wall at a convenient height for moulding and
general work of this character. On one end is a piece of marble,
twelve inches wide by sixteen long, which is used for moulding
purposes. The advantages of such a piece of marble are numerous.
It is as easily cleaned as a dish and requires no scouring,
and, as dough does not readily stick to it, moulding can be done
without the trouble which comes from the use of a board. This
piece of marble is not fastened to the dough-board, as is sometimes
done. Where it is set into the board there will always
be creases in which dough will lodge, and it can only be cleaned
with the greatest trouble. Where it is free, it can be raised
from the board occasionally, and everything thoroughly cleaned.</p>

<p>At the right of the board is the flour-bin, which contains
places for various kinds of flour and meal. Next to it is the
refrigerator. Over the refrigerator is a window which opens
on the porch, and through which the ice may be placed without
the iceman going through the kitchen with his wet feet and
dripping load.</p>

<p>At the left of the dough-board are shelves for keeping stores.
The lower shelves are enclosed by doors and provided with a
lock, so that extra stores may be placed there for safe keeping,
where this is found desirable. The upper shelves are exposed.
On them are kept sugar, tea, coffee, baking-powder, and kindred
stores, which are in every-day use, and can be reached easier if
there are no doors to be opened and closed. They should be
kept in air-tight cans, which prevent their exposure to dust, insects,
and air. Back of the door opening into the kitchen are
hooks for the utensils which more properly belong in the pantry
than the kitchen.</p>

<p>Many housekeepers prefer to keep the refrigerator in the
cellar, on account of the waste in the ice. This waste, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
mind of the writer, is a small matter. The time spent by either
housekeeper or servant in going into the cellar could much
better be occupied in doing something else which would save
more than does keeping the refrigerator below. Then, again,
when it is kept in the pantry it can readily be provided with a
zinc drain to the outside, which saves some little labor. In the
cellar such a drain would only be possible where sand could be
reached. A refrigerator should never, under any circumstances,
be drained into the sewer, as is sometimes done.</p>

<p>The utensils which properly belong to the kitchen are kept
in an old-fashioned kitchen safe, rather than in a closet opening
out from the kitchen. A safe is more readily cleaned than a
closet, and the perforated metal doors render the upper part of
it an excellent place for storing cold food, which it is not desirable
to keep in the refrigerator. Then if, as may happen in any
kitchen which is left to the care of servants, vermin should take
possession, the safe can be moved from the room, and trouble
from this source avoided.</p>

<p>The entrance to the cellar is near the table, as marked. At
the head of the cellar are placed brooms, mops, and dust-pans,
and above these, well away from the head when going below,
is a shelf upon which two buckets can be placed.</p>

<p>Back of the range is a small wooden box, thirty inches long
by twenty-two inches wide and twelve inches deep, which is
provided with a door and shelves. These shelves, as well as the
top and bottom, have holes bored through them in order to
allow the passage of hot air. In this box scrubbing-rags and
brushes dry at once, and never have a bad odor. The box is
of the same wood as the other kitchen finish, and looks as if it
were a part of it.</p>

<p>A soap-box, with construction similar to the above, may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
provided. It should have a tin-pipe connection with flue or
other ventilating apparatus. It will dry the soap and render
its use less wasteful.</p>

<p>The ventilation of the kitchen is an important matter. The
ideal kitchen has no rooms over it, and has ventilators in the
ceiling. But this is not possible in most houses, and a substitute
must be provided. An inverted sheet-iron hopper placed
over the range, with an opening into either the flue or the outside
of the house, will carry out the odors from cooking. An
opening into the pipe-duct which holds the plumbing pipes will
keep them from freezing in cold weather at the same time that
it helps ventilate.</p>

<p>An important consideration in a kitchen is to build it so that
it will not readily accumulate dirt, and can be easily cleaned. A
large amount of time is spent in every well-kept house in cleaning
the kitchen. The floor should be of oak, maple, or other
hard wood, oiled, waxed, or finished with regular floor-finishing.
The casings and doors are, of course, kept in better condition,
with less labor, when of hard wood. Where this is not attainable,
poplar, or other similar wood, finished with a varnish which
will stand warm water, will prove a very good substitute. The
tables should be either of oak, which requires little scrubbing, or
poplar, which is so easily scrubbed that it is always white enough
to delight the heart of the most particular housekeeper. A
kitchen finished in this way is much less care than when the
floor is of soft wood, and the finish a soft wood painted.</p>

<p>All kitchens in this book are planned according to the principles
here set forth. They do not pretend to be exactly like
this one, but the same general principle runs through all.</p>

<p>There are very good reasons why wainscoting should not be
used in a kitchen, and no compensating advantages. The bead-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>joints
and extra wood-work thereof make labor in the impossible
task of keeping it clean. The less wood-work there is in a
kitchen, the better. There are various kind of water-proof proprietary
plaster finishes which may be used in finishing the walls
and ceiling of a kitchen. Where they are not used, a white
skim coat should be put on and painted after about a year&#8217;s use.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>CELLAR.&mdash;FUEL DEPARTMENTS.&mdash;FURNACE CONVENIENCES.&mdash;COAL-BINS.&mdash;CEMENT
FLOORS.&mdash;LIGHT IN THE CELLAR.&mdash;A CELLAR-CLOSET.&mdash;OUTSIDE
CELLAR-DOOR.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>The cellar was originally a hole in the ground. In the
modern house, that is arranged to please the house-keeper,
it is well lighted; provided with a smooth cement floor
that is easily cleaned; is not open as one room, but has
apartments&mdash;one for a laundry, another for fuel and furnace,
and still others for fruits and general stores. In the matter of
fuel there is no reason why the entire winter supply should not
be in the basement. It is certainly a great deal worse to go
outside of the house in winter time from a hot, steaming kitchen,
than it is to go into the basement for the fuel. However, there
is some objection to storing wood in the cellar, for the reason
that it brings bugs, ants, and vermin into the house.</p>

<p>Coal-bins should be constructed with hopper bottoms,&mdash;with
bottom and sides slanting from level of outside grade-line to cellar
floor,&mdash;where the location will admit of it. When there is not
a cellar under all of the house, it is generally possible to arrange
the coal-bin under the part without cellar, and slanting down to
the part so used. This is illustrated in plan <a href="#Plan_11">No. 11</a>, Chapter
XX. There the coal is put through the windows into the bins,
and slides down to the opening in cellar. For each shovelful
of coal taken away from the lower opening, another will take
its place. This is particularly true with crushed coke, or anthra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>cite
coal, or nut and egg sizes of other fuel. The lump sizes
require a larger opening than the usual twenty-inch-square
opening for the coal mentioned. These bins should be lined on
the bottom preferably with bricks laid in cement. If this is not
used, two-inch oak boards will do. Partitions of the same
material should be used to separate the various bins. With an
arrangement of this kind a large amount of storage capacity can
be provided. Under some circumstances this plan cannot be
adopted. In such a case the ordinary bins may be used.</p>

<p>As houses are now planned, the first tier of joists are placed
from twenty to twenty-four inches above the grade-line. Where
it is not possible to secure that height for cellar-windows, areas
may be built of brick or stone, and additional light provided.
Light is the enemy of disorder and uncleanliness; where there
is exposure there will be less disorder.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to have the cellar under the whole house,
for reasons as mentioned, and on account of the cost. It is
sometimes important that savings of all kinds be made. The
furnace may be set in a pit with its face directed to the cellar.
It is best that the opening from the hoppered coal-bins, above
described, be close to the furnace. If it can be opened at the
side, so that one can stand in the pit and throw coal in the fire-box,
it is better than any other arrangement.</p>

<p>The ordinary cellar is seven feet in the clear, and, for this
reason, it is nearly always necessary to pit the furnace. This is
done by digging an extra depth, and lining the area and opening
with brick.</p>

<p>Near enough to the furnace to be warm, should be a closet
for canned fruit, made of flooring-boards, if not of more substantial
material, and provided with a door and lock. It should
be shelved with board about seven inches apart. Other winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
stores, like potatoes, cabbage, etc., should be kept in a dark
cellar with an earth floor. It is the opinion of farmers and
others that vegetables keep best when lying next the ground.
The cellar-involving arrangements here outlined may be seen
in plan <a href="#Plan_11">No. 11</a>. The outside door, which leads into the cellar,
should bolt on the inside, and the upper cellar door on the
outside. There should be doors provided to separate the different
rooms. Where cost is an item, they may be made of two
thicknesses of flooring. Cellar-windows should be hung on
hinges, and provided with bolt fastenings; catches are not
secure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>A LOW-COST LAUNDRY.&mdash;BLUE MONDAY.&mdash;BASEMENT LAUNDRY.&mdash;LOW-COST
CONVENIENCES.&mdash;INEXPENSIVE LAUNDRY FITTINGS.&mdash;HOT
AND COLD WATER ARRANGEMENTS.&mdash;A LABOR-SAVING
LAUNDRY.&mdash;A PLACE TO DO FRUIT-CANNING.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>The term &#8220;Blue Monday&#8221; probably originated on account
of its being general wash-day, and a day in which everybody
about the house undertook to do an impossible amount of
work with limited resources.</p>

<p>Most of the washings in this country are done in the kitchen.
The wash-boiler is on the stove, and the servant or mistress of
the house, or both, attempt to wash and do their cooking without
seriously disturbing the routine of meals. There is a fussiness
about everything pertaining to that day, which creates
an atmosphere of blueness which is proverbial. The steamy,
crowded kitchen, the almost inevitable wetness or slipperiness,
the great physical exertion required, the carrying of water, the
lifting of tubs, are all uncomfortable, and the work is done at a
great disadvantage. In an expensive house, where there is
plenty of money, Monday is not so blue. Immunity is purchased.
Possibly the clothes are sent from the house to be
washed in somebody else&#8217;s kitchen; maybe to be worn by
some one else before they are returned, and often to be injured
or destroyed by the strong washing-mixtures and soaps, which
are made to save rubbing. This kind of immunity is expensive.
It is too expensive for the large majority of people. It is annoying
to all alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Laundry work will sometime be done at a cost which will
admit of people of moderate means having this work done at a
public laundry. At present, the general laundry work of an
ordinary household cannot be done in this way, on account of the
expense.</p>

<p>The general public laundry, where arrangements are made
to do the entire family washing at a low cost, is a complete solution
of the Blue-Monday problem; but until the laundry is an
accomplished fact, such work will be done at home, and a family
laundry must be considered in house-building. It would be a
very easy matter to arrange a laundry which would meet all the
desired conditions, if we were to operate independent of cost,
but the large majority of people are not independent in this way.
If it were not a matter of cost, we would have an independent
room for the laundry work, with porcelain tubs, and hot and
cold water running into all of them; we could have a steam-drier,
and many other things, which it is useless to mention
here. It is the laundry of the moderate-cost house which interests
the largest number of people.</p>

<p>We must have a place to do laundry work which is a compromise
between the foggy kitchen and the laundry with
porcelain tubs.</p>

<p>As houses are now built, the first floor is usually from two
and a half to three feet above the grade. This affords abundant
opportunity of getting a well-lighted basement. If the basement
is dark, put more windows in it, and whitewash the walls
and ceilings. Cement the floor. Put in a slop sink, and give
it a trapped connection with the vault or sewer. Provide a
pump over this sink to connect with the cistern. If the city
water is soft, this will be used and no pump will be required.
Then a laundry stove is to be provided. Thus we have every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>thing
ready for use without much labor, and certainly at a very
low cost.</p>

<p>The basement should be light under any circumstances.
The floor should be cemented, the joists should be whitewashed,
so that the only additions necessary to make the laundry work
easy are a laundry stove, a place to throw waste water, and a
supply of hot and cold water. If one does not care to heat the
water in the ordinary boiler, there is a very simple device for
heating water which may be placed in any laundry. An open
tank, which will hold two or three barrels of water, can be placed
over the stove and next to the joist. From it a connection
can be made with the laundry stove by means of lead and iron
pipe. This pipe should start from the bottom of the tank and
connect with an iron pipe which enters the stove, and passes
around the inside of the fire-pot, then to the outside and connects
with another lead pipe, which empties into the tank again
on a level above the first opening. Thus the cold water would
come from the bottom of the tank, through the stove where
it would be heated, thence upward and into the tank. This
would give a hot-water circulating connection, and in this way
provide hot water for use in the laundry. This arrangement
would require a low-cost force-pump to force the water to the
tank. There are many kinds of these pumps, which are substantial
and can be secured at a low cost. The pipe from the stove
could be supplied with a compression cock from which the water
could be drawn into the tubs. The better way would be to
have an independent tank connection. Lead pipe was mentioned
as being the pipe to use in making the connection with
the iron pipe in the laundry stove. Galvanized iron pipe would
answer every purpose and cost a little less. Where set tubs
are not used, the water could be readily distributed by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
a hose pipe. If the above arrangement is too expensive, the
stove only can be used for heating water.</p>

<p>Set tubs might be used instead of the ordinary wooden ones
which were contemplated, and would save a good deal of labor,
but the cost is something which all cannot afford. The arrangement
described here can be reached by nearly every one of moderate
means. It provides a place to throw slop water, and brings
hot and cold water close at hand. It isolates the washing from
the cooking, and the smell of washing from the whole house.
It is very different from the conditions in most houses, where the
water has to be carried from the backyard into the house, lifted
to the stove, poured into the tubs, and afterward carried out, a
bucket at a time, and emptied over the back fence, if the tub is
not dragged out and emptied into the yard.</p>

<p>It is well in building a new house to have an outside cellar-way
to facilitate the use of the laundry below. In such a case
the clothes can be carried into the yard without being taken
through the kitchen. There will be times when the weather will
not permit taking the clothes outdoors. In very cold weather
it should never be done. It is murderous for a woman to have
to carry clothes from a hot, steamy laundry or kitchen at eighty
degrees to the cold, dry air of the outside. There is no woman
so strong that she can stand this. All the clothes can be readily
dried in the basement. Here is presented another argument in
favor of the laundry below. The washing can always be done
at the appointed time in spite of the weather. When one goes
into a large attic he is apt to say, &#8220;What a splendid place to
dry clothes.&#8221; People who dry clothes in the attic usually do the
washing in the kitchen.</p>

<p>A basement laundry is a cool place in summer and a warm
one in winter. There is no better place for ironing in warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
weather, for even with a fire the basement is always cool. Nor
can there be a better place for canning fruit. The conveniences
of plenty of water, a fire, and yet a cool place for doing
this extremely laborious work, will be readily appreciated.</p>

<blockquote><p><small>THE SECOND FLOOR.&mdash;STAIRWAYS.&mdash;THE COMBINATION STAIRWAY.&mdash;IDEAL

<p>In many houses a combination stairway is used. By this is
meant one in which the front and rear stairways run together
in a common landing. In this case, there should be doors separating
the rear from the front stairway, one at the beginning,
and one at the end of the rear part. The combination stairway
is a compromise. Oftentimes, however, one can secure other
things which are desirable by its use. There are other compromises
more objectionable than the combination stairway.</p>

<p>A stairway of this kind is not used as the most desirable
thing, but as the least objectionable of other compromises; for
instance, if one can secure, for a given cost, an additional room
or two by using a combination stairway, the room is frequently
preferable. No one can doubt but that a front stairway, entirely
separated from the one in the rear, is the best thing to have;
however, it is easy to understand that a combination stairway
may be used for reasons above stated. In some of the plans
a stairway is shown, starting from a stair-hall in the rear of
reception-hall or room. Under such circumstances, a combination
is not necessary. One can come from the kitchen and
go upstairs without being observed from the other parts of the
house. Again, combinations are sometimes used so that they
apply to the servant&#8217;s room as a continuous stairway, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a combination to the other parts of the house. This is true
of several plans given.</p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to say that a stairway should be
easy, still it is known that not all are so. The one in the front
part of the building should always be made without winders;
that in the rear, the same way if possible. Landings are preferable,
and make a staircase beautiful. Stairways may be considered
from a hygienic standpoint. This, however, is not necessary
in this connection. Where there is only one stairway, it is
not uncommon to have it start from the dining-room, and, if
one stops to think about it, this is not a bad arrangement.
The dining-room is centrally located, and the stairway may be
used by the servants when this room is not otherwise in use.
Certainly it is less objectionable than placing it in a hall
through which all have to pass, or where it is necessary to pass
through other rooms to reach the second floor from the rear.
A combination stairway, or one that starts up from the dining-room,
is less objectionable in a house where there is a bath-room
on the second floor than it would otherwise be. Where the
bath-room is so placed, it is not necessary that the slops be carried
down or the water carried up stairs; and, in other respects,
it is less necessary to use the stairway in a disagreeable way.</p>

<p>The rear stairway should be connected with the front part
of the house by means of a hall on the second floor. It is generally
found desirable to have a girl&#8217;s room near the rear stairway,
and to cut off that part of the house from the front by means
of a door. There should be means of lighting, artificial and
otherwise, at the beginning and landings of all stairways.</p>

<p>In a young and growing family, five is the ideal number of
rooms for the second floor. This number may be increased or
decreased according to the size and development of the family.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Where there are five rooms it affords, first, a family room in
front, built over the parlor or sitting-room; next to that is a
room in front for the very young children, and afterwards for the
girls; then the room in the rear of the family room may be for
the boys; the fourth room for guests, and the fifth for the servant.
The guest-room view is to the side and the rear. There
are cases where one must accommodate a large number of people
with a smaller number of rooms, and, again, a larger number
of rooms is thought indispensable. In connection with the size
of bedrooms, we may say what was said before,&mdash;that their
availability does not depend entirely upon their size. A room
may be large and still not contain a place for a bed or other
furniture. It may be moderately small and yet have space
for all.</p>

<p>The more we think about the arrangement of houses, the
larger appear the number of indispensables. It used to be
thought unnecessary to have a closet in every bedroom; one
was certainly enough in the family room. Now it is almost a
necessity that there be two closets in the family room&mdash;one for
the lady, and a smaller one for the gentleman. There should
certainly be one closet in every bedroom, and, in addition to that,
one which opens from the hall, to be used for bed-linen and
general bedroom supplies. A suitable place for brooms and
dust-pans is the attic stairway when a special closet is not
provided.</p>

<p>In lighting bedrooms there should be at least one window
for each outside exposure. Where the size will admit, there
should be two windows placed so that the dressing-case can be
set between them, either in the corner or otherwise. Most bedrooms
are lighted artificially by bracket lights instead of the
centre light. There should be one bracket on each side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
dressing-case; if not, a pendent light immediately over it.
Centre connections for gas-fixture are usually provided, but
in practice many houses are not supplied with the fixture.</p>

<p>Grates on the second floor make work: carrying of fuel and
ashes is always disagreeable in the extremest degree. The
placing of ash-pits in the cellar may make it unnecessary to carry
the ashes, but still grates make work. At the same time it is
very pleasant to have a grate in the bedroom; they are the best
means of ventilation known.</p>

<p>The servant&#8217;s room is not usually very large, seldom large
enough. It should be provided with a closet, the same as other
rooms. The window in that room should be set high enough
from the floor so as to admit of the placing of a trunk under it,
without interfering with the light or in other ways appearing
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The bath-room and general plumbing work are considered
in detail in the following chapter. It is sufficient to say that
there should be as little wood-work as possible in the bath-room.
Water-proof plastering should be used, and when this becomes
soiled it can be washed and painted.</p>

<p>There is nothing a housekeeper appreciates more than a good
attic and an easy stairway leading to it. Often attics are not
plastered; they should always be floored at the same time
the house is built. Where it is not possible to make divisions
by plastering, and other substantial material, light wooden partitions
will serve the purpose of providing means of classifying
that which is stored in the attic, and prevent it from being in a
continual state of disorder. The rooms may be fitted with
shelves, closets, etc.</p>

<p>Where it is possible so to do, the attic room should be plastered.
It makes the rooms below appreciably cooler in summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
In most of the plans herein illustrated, the roof is high enough
to provide space for good rooms, with ceilings as high and as
square as those of the rooms below. It is cheaper to provide
rooms in this way than to spread over more ground; and there
is certainly no valid objection to their use by the boys of the
family.</p>

<p>In considering the plumbing apparatus of a house, the question
is often asked, &#8220;Are these things safe? Do they not endanger
the health of the occupants of the house?&#8221; The answer is,
The plumbing apparatus may be entirely safe. That it is not
always so, we all know. We hear of many cases of typhoid
fever, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and other diseases, which are
traceable to, or aggravated by, defective plumbing. In some
sections of the country so much trouble has been caused by poor
plumbing, that the people, as a class, have come to be suspicious
of all. The reason for this is the effort to cheapen the work.
Suffering from bad work has led to safety. In larger cities this
work is under the control of the city government. It may be
said that it is possible so to arrange the fixtures and apparatus
appertaining to plumbing that it is entirely safe. The question
naturally follows, &#8220;How is this done?&#8221;</p>

<p>It may be said that good work is not a great deal more expensive
than poor work. Again, good work is not always a
question of money. It is one of knowledge or inclination on
the part of the plumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>One in moderate circumstances, who builds a house to cost
from twenty-five hundred to four thousand dollars, should have
well water or city water, and hot and cold cistern water in the
sink in the kitchen. There should be at least a slop-hopper
in the laundry. In the bath-room a water-closet, a tub, and
generally a wash-stand. This latter feature is not absolutely
necessary, as will be explained later. In the attic there should
be a tank to hold the cistern water, which is connected with the
fixtures using soft water below. A force-pump, or water-motor,
may be located in the kitchen or basement to lift the water to
tank. In more elaborate houses a completer plumbing apparatus
may be used. There may be an especial sink in the china-closet.
There may be wash-stands in the various chambers, and
one on the first floor.</p>

<p>There may be, also, an additional water-closet on the first
floor, or in the cellar, located where it is accessible to the members
of the family. There are many ways of expending money in
plumbing fixtures; but, with those first mentioned, one may be
entirely comfortable, and derive all of the housekeeping benefits
which may be expected from such conveniences. Unless the
house be large, an increase in the number of fixtures would
increase the amount of work done in keeping them clean, rather
than save labor.</p>

<p>In the matter of safety, another question, which sometimes
arises, is as to the danger from the plumbing apparatus where
there is no sewer connection, or where it has to be made with
a vault. The protection against sewer-gas is not from the
sewer itself or the vault. It is entirely through protective
apparatus in the house, and the manner of the connection with
the vault or sewer.</p>

<p>One may consider the conditions of safety in plumbing ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>paratus
under two general heads. First, as to the workmanship;
second, as to design or plan of the apparatus. Nothing need
be said as to the workmanship, excepting that the execution of
the design, or the benefits to be derived from it, maybe entirely
lost by defective workmanship. If the work is not properly
executed, the design need not be considered. The result will
be bad irrespective of the plan.</p>

<p>In considering the design of the apparatus, we will take into
account the arrangement of the connections and fixtures. By
the latter expression is meant the tub, the water-closet, the
wash-bowl, and the sink, pump, etc. The connections which
have to do with the safety of the apparatus are the traps and
the waste pipes, or pipes which connect with the vault or sewer.</p>

<p>The main waste pipe inside the house is called the soil pipe.
The smaller waste pipes from the fixtures connect with it. The
soil pipe is of cast-iron, and usually four inches in diameter on
the inside. It connects, full size, with the water-closet. Most
other wastes are of lead, and are usually an inch and a half in
diameter. In the soil and waste pipes there will naturally be
the odors from the vaults and sewer, or from the foul matter
which is in or passing through the pipes. Therefore, there must
be means in each waste pipe, which connects a fixture with the
main soil pipe, of preventing the passage of gas or air from it
into the house. This is done by means of what is called a trap.
The &#8220;S&#8221; trap is the commonest form; this name is given
it from its shape, and illustrates its construction. If we take a
letter S and turn it sideways we will get the form of such a trap.
The right side or end would continue directly down toward the
drain or soil pipe, and the left side would continue upward and
connect with the fixture (see <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). The water from the fixture
comes down and is forced upward through the bend by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
pressure of water above, and from thence runs into the soil pipe
or drain. Thus it will be seen that there is always a seal of
water in the trap. There is always water in the
trap as indicated by the depth of the bend of the S.
There are hundreds of different forms of traps, but
they are all constructed on the same principle; the
idea being that the gas or air from the pipe would
have to pass through the water in order to get into
the house. The water in the trap is called the
seal; it seals the passage of air as stated.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a id="Fig_6" name="Fig_6"></a>
<img src="images/fig_6.png" width="200" height="107" alt="Fig. 6" title="Fig. 6" />
</div>

<p>There are many conditions under which a trap may fail to
do its full duty. It may be foul in itself, or it may be rendered
foul by the bad air in the drain. The trap may be siphoned by
a heavy flow of water through the main drain, or it may be
siphoned by a string or a rag which may readily find its way into
the trap, and hang over the bend so that all of the water will run
out. Again, the water in the trap may evaporate. All these
dangers may be guarded against. In the first place, there
should be means which allow fresh air to pass through all that
portion of the main drain or soil pipe which is in or close to
the house. The means of accomplishing this are various.</p>

<p>The soil pipe is ventilated by continuing up through and
well above the roof with a full opening at the top. The smaller
drains should be ventilated in the same way when far removed
from main soil pipe or other connection. The traps should be
ventilated by 1&frac12;-inch or two-inch connections with the outer air,
as shown by cut.</p>

<p>Frequent use of plumbing fixtures contributes to safety.
It causes a large volume of water to pass through the pipes.
The flushing of the pipes and drains in this way makes them
cleaner and thus safer. It is frequently said by those who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
plumbing fixtures in their houses that they use them as little as
possible, because they are afraid of them. Nothing worse could
be done. The water in the traps evaporates or becomes foul,
and thus the gas has a free entrance to the house. A water-closet
helps greatly to cleanse the soil pipe and outside drain.
It discharges a large volume of water into it suddenly, in a way
to keep it clean. It is not a bad plan to use the closet at least
once a day, solely for the purpose of flushing the drain. In
houses where there are a number of wash-stands distributed
through the various chambers and halls there is danger from
neglect in using them. The water seal in the traps may evaporate,
and thus give direct sewer-air connection with the house.
Particularly is this so in the guest&#8217;s room. A wash-stand is a
more dangerous fixture for this reason than any other in the
house.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<a id="Fig_7" name="Fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/fig_7.png" width="355" height="400" alt="Fig. 7" title="Fig. 7" />
</div>

<p>The water-closet problem has received a great deal of attention. A few
years ago they were quite complicated, there being levers and pipes,
pans, springs and weights, to a degree of complexity which caused a
great deal of trouble. There has since been a return to first principles
and great simplicity. The water-closet of to-day is nothing more or less
than a large bowl connected by means of an &#8220;S&#8221; trap four inches in
diameter with the soil pipe, and provided with means of flushing with
large volumes of water. Such a closet is known as the &#8220;washout closet.&#8221;

In other closets there is an intermediate plunger-valve separating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the hopper from the trap. The plunger-valve is defined by its
name. It is a large stopper which plunges into and closes up the
opening to the trap by means of its own weight when released.
That which makes one closet different from another has to do
more with means of flushing than anything else. By flushing is
meant the pouring into and distribution of water in the hopper.
The most popular closets, those which have given the most
satisfaction, are &#8220;washout&#8221; closets, made entirely of white
earthenware, not alone the bowl, but the trap and connecting
neck. Closets are best flushed from an independent tank,
which is placed about seven feet above the closet and connects
with it by means of 1&frac14;-inch pipe. The height gives it a strong
flush of water, which cleanses it thoroughly.</p>

<p>In the past it has been usual to conceal the earthenware or
iron body of the closet. It is best to leave it entirely open
around the sides, that the entire apparatus may be exposed.
Sometimes it is necessary to support the flap and seat by legs,
though the modern closets are arranged so that all of the woodwork
may be secured to the upper part of the hopper or the wall.
There should be the solid flap covering to the wooden seat with
the opening in it, both of which should be hinged, so as to
allow them to be thrown back. It is convenient to use the
water-closet as a slop hopper. In order to do this the seat
should be hinged, so that it may be thrown back out of the
way.</p>

<p>One frequently hears it said by those who exercise their
authority over household matters that they do not allow anything
to be put into the water-closet except that which is
naturally intended for it; meaning that they do not allow the
slop water to be put into it. There is no reason in this. The
closet that cannot be used for this purpose cannot, with safety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
be allowed in the house. The use of the water-closet as a slop
sink is not only legitimate but desirable. It flushes the drain.</p>

<p>There is a movement toward simplicity in general plumbing
apparatus. At the time the water-closets were in the complicated
state mentioned, everything pertaining to plumbing was in the
same general condition. It was thought necessary to fill a house
with a wilderness of pipes and traps to have it safe or satisfactory.
The very complexity of the arrangement made it not only
unsafe but expensive to maintain.</p>

<p>We have all heard a great deal about the expense of maintaining
a plumbing plant, if it may be so called. There is no
reason why there should be constant repairs and expense.
It is pleasant to know that additional expense is not necessary
to secure immunity from trouble. The idea of simplicity in
arrangement, general excellence in the fixtures, material, and
labor, which go to form the completed work, has to be borne in
mind. The arrangement of the plumbing apparatus has to be
planned with the same care and thoughtfulness as the other parts
of the house.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that if the pipes are placed in a
position where the temperature is liable to fall below thirty-two
degrees the water in the pipes will freeze. Thus it is suggested
that all pipes should be on an inside wall,&mdash;if possible,
next to the kitchen flue,&mdash;and that there be here arranged
an especial pipe duct of wood to ventilate the kitchen, and, at
the same time, keep the pipes from freezing by means of the
warm air which will pass through it. This duct should be covered
on the face with a wide board, which can be readily removed
by taking out a few screws. Thus the pipes may be exposed at
any time desirable.</p>

<p>If the hot-water boiler in the kitchen is surrounded by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
enclosure which has an opening in the bottom, and which connects
from above with the pipe duct previously described,
there will be a current of warm air passing upward through the
pipe duct as long as there is warm water in the boiler. The
water in the boiler will be warm long after everything else is
cold. This will insure safety from freezing when other helps fail.</p>

<p>The cistern water is supplied to the bath-room, and to the
hot-water reservoir, by means of a tank placed in the attic, or at
least above the highest fixture. It sometimes happens that the
supply pipe from the tank above the attic floor freezes. All
this may be prevented by enclosing the tank, and the pipe
which connects with it, with a large box or canvas covering
which is six or eight inches larger than the tank. This confines
the warm air from the duct mentioned, so that as long as there
is heat it will always be in this enclosure.</p>

<p>The outside drain, which connects with the vault or sewer,
is, in some instances, trapped previous to its entrance to the
sewer or vault. In such cases, this trap should have a connection
with the outer air, and on the side of the trap towards the
house. Sometimes this outer-air connection is made into the
water spout from the roof; but this is not proper, for the reason
that the sewer gas, or the gas from the vault, is almost certain
to destroy the spout. Again, this spout may come out near
a dormer, or may pass near a window, and in either case may
contaminate the air in the house. It is better that this ventilating
connection should be in the yard, at some distance from
the house, or, better yet, that there should be a long iron pipe
extending well above the ground. It should be understood that
this vent has no direct connection with the sewer, but merely
with the soil pipe and drain back of the trap; with that part
of it which is nearest to, and in, the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>Sometimes it is necessary to run the down spouts into the
sewer connection; in such a case one should be certain that
the down-spout openings are not near the dormers, and that
they have no connection whatever with the cistern. It is common
to have a switch or cut-off in the down spout, so that the
latter may be connected either with the cistern or sewer. This
is very bad practice. While it is connected with the sewer or
with the drain pipe, the down spout is contaminated with all
the foulness of the air of the drain. On its being connected
with the cistern, the water is poisoned.</p>

<p>Immunity from sewer gas in the house is largely dependent
upon the flushing and ventilation of the drain and the soil pipe.
In the case of a drain which is trapped as described, there is
an air connection through the vent before the trap; then the
soil pipe which is in the house should continue upward through
the roof. Thus there is a fresh air inlet through the drain, and
upward through the soil pipe of the house. Such a connection
prevents the possibility of siphoning the traps, as it gives an
outward air connection. The water passing through the drain
or soil pipe can draw its supply of air from the upward soil vent,
rather than through the traps which contain water. When there
is no upward vent of the soil or drain, the water in the traps
which connect therewith will be drawn out by the passage of
water through the drain where fixtures are used.</p>

<p>There are those who maintain that there should be no trap
in the yard or adjacent to the house, but that there should be
a straight run from the soil pipe to the sewer or vault, and
upward through the roof and above the house. It is good
practice to use the trap as described for sewer connections, but
not for open vault connections.</p>

<p>A grease sink is frequently placed in the drain to intercept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the passage of grease into the vault. It is so placed and connected
that only the water from the kitchen sink, or other fixtures
where the water contains grease, may enter it. It is made
of brick, and is usually of six or eight barrels capacity. A four-inch
pipe connects it with the kitchen waste, and if the grease
sink is placed adjacent to the main drain, there can be a similar
connection between it and the main drain. It should be a
siphon connection, so that the sink will become nearly full
before it discharges. When it discharges through the siphon
the water will go out with a rush and leave the grease in the
sink. This makes an intermittent discharge into the main drain,
which flushes or cleanses it thoroughly and is much better than
a constant small flow of water. This grease sink must be
cleaned from time to time. Small cast-iron grease sinks are
sometimes placed under kitchen sinks in very large dwellings or
hotels.</p>

<p>Nothing particular need be said in regard to wash-stands
more than has been said, excepting, possibly, that the drain
should be trapped, ventilated, and connected with the soil pipe;
also that there should be a lead safe or safety pan on the floor
under the wash-stand when they are enclosed; it is preferable
that they should remain unenclosed. It has been common to
connect this safe with the soil pipe. It is only intended that
it should be useful in cases of accidental overflow; but, notwithstanding
the fact that there be a trap in the safe waste or
drain, it would be empty most of the time, because of the evaporation
of the water. It is proper to make direct connection
with the cellar or kitchen sink.</p>

<p>The bath-tub should have the same-sized drain connection
as the wash-stand; that is, one and one-half inch in
diameter, trapped. The overflows from both the wash-stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and tub should be flushed with hot water quite frequently, to
avoid the soap smells which are so common to bath-rooms.
It often happens that those who have bath-rooms in their
houses imagine that they smell sewer gas, when it is nothing
more or less than the smell of rancid soap.</p>

<p>It is only within a short time that the heating and ventilation
of buildings of any kind have been in any measure satisfactory.
This applies only to the largest buildings; the heating and
ventilating of smaller structures are still in an unsatisfactory condition.
Most dwelling-houses are heated with stoves, which, as
now arranged, are not successful. The same air is heated over
and over again. Fresh air in the proper quantities or from the
proper source is not supplied to the interior of the building.
Grates are very well in their way in that they take large quantities
of air from the room. Thus far they ventilate. The supply
of air is necessarily irregular, unless special means are provided.</p>

<p>Furnaces are used for heating a very large number of houses.
While they are satisfactory in some respects, they are deficient
in others. The same thing may be said of steam, hot-water,
or other heating apparatus.</p>

<p>As the statement has been made that heating systems in
general, as applied to dwelling-houses, are unsatisfactory, it may
be well to state the fault, and what is to be desired. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the purpose to consider this question chemically, or from a
highly scientific standpoint; there is no occasion for it. It is
well to bear in mind that we are considering the heating and
ventilating of a house during cold weather, and not its ventilation
during the summer, when natural means are to be relied upon.
Then it may be asked, What is to be done? Primarily the
air should be at the proper temperature at all times; it should
be in its pure state, as found on the outside of the building, and
not contaminated with any of the gases of combustion. It
should be supplied with its proper equivalent of moisture at the
temperature at which we find it in the room. As it becomes
impure from natural causes, there should be some means of
effecting its withdrawal.</p>

<p>These are the ideal conditions. How far do they exist in
practice? The temperature is ordinarily high enough. The air
of the room is apt to be contaminated by the gases of combustion,
and vitiated by breathing and otherwise. Rarely indeed
does it contain its proper equivalent of moisture; it is dry and
parched. Now that we know the conditions in their ideal state
and as they exist in fact, we will consider in detail what may be
done to bring about more satisfactory results. If the heating
apparatus be a furnace, it should be constructed of steel or
wrought-iron plate, the joints thoroughly riveted and calked; or,
if of other material, it should certainly be gas-tight. Every
precaution should be taken to prevent the passage of the air of
combustion from the furnace to the warm-air chambers and from
thence to the rooms above. The furnace is nothing more or
less than a large stove with various radiating arrangements,
surrounded by an iron or brick enclosure, with a supply of fresh
air from the outside, and with connecting tin pipes to the rooms
above. It is important that the inner parts, the fire-pot, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
radiating surface, etc., be thoroughly well built and gas-tight, to
prevent the heated air from becoming contaminated by the
gases of combustion. The supply of outer air should be ample.
It should be so arranged that it can never be entirely cut off.
The furnace should be of sufficient capacity so that means of
reducing the outer air supply should not be necessary. However,
if such arrangements are made, they should be limited.</p>

<p>The proper equivalent of moisture should be given to the
air at the temperature at which it reaches the room. It may be
said that there is a water-pan connected with every furnace,
that will do everything necessary in supplying moisture. This
is a mistake. So far as I know, the furnace or other heating
apparatus for dwellings has not been constructed which is provided
with a proper evaporating apparatus. The pan is set in
the side of the furnace, with an opening to the outside into
which water may be poured. It is small, and has very little
evaporating surface on the inside. Oftentimes the joints at the
outside are so poorly made that the cold air from the cellar may
be drawn in over the water in the pan, and in that way prevent
its proper evaporation. Winter air heated to a summer temperature
is dry and parched, whereas natural summer air contains
the proper amount of moisture. The outer air during the winter
time has its proper equivalent of moisture for the winter temperature,
which is a much smaller amount than would belong to it
at a higher temperature. Therefore when we take winter air
into the furnace or other heating apparatus, raise it to a summer
temperature, and carry it into a room, we have a very dry
air, which seeks its equivalent of moisture from the occupants
of the room, from the furniture, carpets, walls, ceiling, and
everything in it. The air will not take additional moisture
unless that moisture be supplied after it has reached a higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
temperature. For instance, if a spray or a series of wet blankets
be arranged in the cold-air duct, before the air gets to the furnace,
the air will not take the moisture from that spray or from
the damp blankets. The moisture must be supplied after the
air is heated. Where the water-pan is set on the side of the
furnace, and where there is a supply of air through the pan from
the cellar, as there frequently is, evaporation is naturally retarded
by the cold air, as indicated. Again, if this pan be never so
well protected, it is small, the proper amount of evaporating
surface is not presented. An evaporating pan or other device
should be placed above the fire-pot and should occupy a large
proportion of the area of the heating chamber. The supply of
water should not be dependent upon some one&#8217;s attention. It
should be constant by means of a ball-cock or otherwise. It
should run into or drip into a shallow pan, or should be supplied
to sheets of felt or blanket so that the air will come in contact
with the moist surfaces, at the temperature at which it is to go
into the room. Thus it has the proper amount of moisture
which belongs to it at that temperature. In this way we have
winter air from the outside going into the room at a summer
temperature and with a summer equivalent of moisture; that is,
we have summer air in the winter time. People sometimes
undertake to get around this by putting water-pans in the registers,
but they are rarely ample. They are neglected, or they
interfere with the supply of warm air, and are abandoned.</p>

<p>Where a furnace is already in a house, or where it is not
possible to make elaborate arrangements for providing the air
with moisture, there is a very simple makeshift which is quite
effective. It consists in suspending in the registers in the
floor small water receptacles&mdash;a quart bucket answers every
purpose&mdash;in which is placed a broad strip of linen. This cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
should go to the bottom of the receptacle and be long enough
to hang over and below it for several inches. When the bucket
is filled with water this piece of cloth acts as a siphon, and
carries the water, a drop at a time, into the furnace-pipe, where
it is converted into steam. A piece of old table-linen is the
best material to use, for the reason that it carries the water fast
enough, that the heat from the furnace does not dry it out
before it can drop into the pipe; otherwise the cloth becomes dry
at the end, and the siphonage ceases. For the same reason
it should be broad,&mdash;about twelve inches. Where a moderate
heat is carried through the furnace-pipe, three quarts of water
may be evaporated in this way in twenty-four hours from each
bucket. A bucket of the size mentioned does not in any way
interfere with the passage of heat.</p>

<p>The next point for consideration is the means of getting the
foul, contaminated air to the outside. One way is through the
use of grates. Another is by means of ducts in the wall, opening
near the floor, which draw the foul air from the room to
the outside. These should consist of heated flues, with connecting
registers in the ceiling and floor, which may be open
when necessary. Under any circumstances, the grate is best.
Sometimes the flue may be heated by a supply of warm air from
the furnace, or by a steam-pipe in case steam is used for heating
the house. In natural-gas regions, the supply of additional
heat in a flue from a furnace or by a jet would be a small matter.</p>

<p>We have mentioned heating by stoves, grates, and furnaces.
The same principles which apply to the furnishing of fresh air
to a furnace may be applied to a stove. The fact is, they never
have been. A stove should be made, and will be made some
day, that is surrounded on the outside by a second jacket, the
space between being connected with the outer air by means of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
tin tube to the under side of the stove. The supply of cold air
could be so arranged as to be shut off when there was no heat in
the stove. The warm air would pass out at the top of the jacket.
On top of the stove could be placed an evaporating pan, and the
supply of moisture come therefrom. In connection with the
stove-pipe, which should be jacketed, a second ventilating flue,
starting from the floor and having an opening both above and
below, could be arranged, and in that way the supply of fresh
air and withdrawal of impure air could be accomplished.</p>

<p>Next we may speak of steam and hot-water heating. So
far as a change of air and the ventilation of the room are concerned,
heating by direct radiation, that is, by radiators placed
in the room, is no better than stove heating. It may be that
the air is not so severely parched by the extreme heat, also the
escape of steam may contribute somewhat to the moisture of
the air; but the escape of steam is not agreeable, and is not
allowed to exist to any great extent;&mdash;its odor is not always
pleasant. Certainly the addition of moisture to the air by this
means would be a mere makeshift and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Hot-water coils act the same as steam radiators in that they
heat the same air over and over again, and are no better than
stoves, so far as the provision for fresh air, at proper temperature
and humidity, is concerned.</p>

<p>A steam or hot-water apparatus, with indirect radiation, is
superior to furnace heat as ordinarily provided. The means of
supplying moisture to an indirect steam apparatus, as ordinarily
constructed, are not convenient. There is a radiator for each hot-air
connection above, that is, a radiator for each register, with
a distinct and direct supply of outer air thereto. Sometimes
there are two registers connecting with a single radiator. But
under any circumstances the radiators are somewhat separated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
having steam or water connection with the boiler at the proper
point. Steam apparatus for public buildings has been constructed
where the radiators have been bunched, that is, put
into a single chamber, the air passing through the chamber
containing the radiators, where it is heated to the proper temperature,
and the moisture afterwards supplied before it enters
the room. Where this arrangement is used, there must be conductors,
tin or otherwise, from the chamber to the register, as
in the case of a furnace. Again, it will be found that the supply
of air will not be uniform through all of the openings; for instance,
the register that is farthest removed from the warm-air
chamber may fail to act. In this event, auxiliary radiators may
be placed under that register, and the operation of the heating
apparatus greatly facilitated thereby. This plan is superior to a
furnace, and can be applied to hot-water or steam apparatus
in dwellings. The reason that it is superior to a furnace is that
the supply of heat is more uniform. It does not require the
constant firing or attention that is necessary in the case of a
hot-air furnace. It may be known that the temperature does not
change with the pressure of steam or in the same proportion.</p>

<p>There are inexpensive automatic arrangements in connection
with furnaces and steam apparatus, which control the dampers
and keep the steam pressure measurably uniform, as long as
there is fuel of sufficient quantity in the fire-pot. The hot-water
apparatus is more uniform in its operation than steam, and for
that reason more satisfactory.</p>

<p>A furnace plant is the most inexpensive apparatus that may
be used for general heating; the steam apparatus is next higher
as to first cost, though no more expensive in amount of fuel
used. The hot-water apparatus costs more than steam, and is
somewhat more economical in the cost of maintenance. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
is probable that a house of moderate size can be warmed all
over at a less cost, as far as fuel is concerned, by a furnace or a
steam or hot-water heating apparatus than by stoves and grates.
However, grates are generally used in addition to these for
the purpose of comfort and appearance, and for ventilating.
Under such circumstances, they consume very little fuel.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>HEATING DEVICES AS WE FIND THEM.&mdash;FURNACE ESTIMATES.&mdash;COMBINATION
HOT AIR AND HOT WATER.&mdash;DISH-WARMING
ARRANGEMENTS.&mdash;HOW TO GET A GOOD HEATING APPARATUS.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>For the present, people who build must take things as they
find them, and use heating and ventilating apparatus as
regularly manufactured. Experiments are uncertain. The theory
of the proper heating and ventilating of a house as set
forth in previous chapter is correct. The fulfilment of the ideas
in dwelling-house heating remains to be practically worked out.
It is not the business of the architect, or the housewife, or
the owner of the house, to work out these mechanical details.
It will be done in time by competent mechanical experts.</p>

<p>In the estimates subsequently given, the furnace is the only
means considered for general heating. However, this does not
indicate a prejudice in favor of that particular method. The
furnace is considered and figured upon as the ordinary method
of heating houses of moderate cost. It is the least expensive
plant to be used for general heating. Indirect radiation from
hot water or steam is to be preferred to a furnace. A combination
of a hot-air furnace with hot water, or steam, is used with
fair success. In this case, a hot-water coil is placed in an ordinary
furnace, which connects with hot-water radiators in a conservatory
or other room for the purpose of contributing a uniform
degree of heat to that room. The water supply is a tank,
located well above the level of the radiators, and connecting
through an inlet pipe with the coil in the furnace. The proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
means of supplying this tank with water is through a ball-cock
or float-cock, the float of which opens the valve when the water
gets low in the tank. Thus the supply is as constant as the
source. A hot-water radiator of this kind may be used in connection
with a device for warming dishes or keeping food warm.
The heat is gentle, uniform, and constant. This is a general
advantage of all hot-water heating.</p>

<p>Aside from the automatic arrangements for controlling the
steam or water pressure in the heating apparatus, and thus
measurably controlling the temperature in the building, other
more positive automatic arrangements are provided which undertake
to maintain any fixed temperature. These are proprietary
devices, patented and advertised.</p>

<p>Complaints are made of the general inefficiency of everything
under the sun: hence, furnaces and other heating apparatus
come in for their share. An architect is sometimes asked
how he would heat a certain building. He answers, &#8220;Hot water,
steam, or furnace.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t have steam. My uncle
had a steam plant in his house, and they nearly froze to death
all last winter; and they burned over a ton of coal a week.&#8221; The
same things are said, and truly, of every kind of heating apparatus
made, when we consider them in general classes. General
complaints of a similar nature are made of everything.
In regard to the steam plant or hot-water apparatus, or anything
else of which this thing may have been said, one may first
acknowledge its truthfulness, and then consider what it all
means. Something is at fault. It may be that the whole design
of the apparatus is faulty. The design may be right, and the
construction bad. Everything else may be right, but the apparatus
too small; or there may be some little defect which has to
do with the placing of the apparatus in the house. Sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
when everything is in good form, the apparatus does not receive
proper attention: hence trouble.</p>

<p>It may be asked how one is to get a good heating apparatus
for a dwelling-house. The first thing to be determined is,
the particular kind to be used: whether hot-water, steam, or
hot-air furnace. There are many manufacturers of the various
apparatus, who are regularly in the business. To these may be
submitted plans of the building, and a request for estimates and
suggestions. It is the experience of an architect that one who
is putting money regularly in the manufacture or production of
anything will not waste his energies for a great length of time
on a bad thing, if he knows it. The evidence that an establishment
has been putting up good furnaces or other heating apparatus
is long-continued business success. If the owner of a
house writes to an old-established, wealthy concern, and sends
his plans, he is as certain to get a reliable proposition as he
can be of anything. A local agent of an establishment of this
kind may misrepresent, unintentionally or otherwise. The surest
way is to go to headquarters. The local agent does not always
know exactly what should be done. A competent architect can
settle all these matters for an owner. However, if an architect
says there are only one or two furnaces or heating apparatus
which are all right, he is either ignorant or dishonest. There
are many different kinds which will give fair satisfaction.</p>

<p>The idea in this chapter is to take things as we find them,
and suggest what may be done. The theories outlined in the
previous chapter may be correct, but they do not amount to
anything to a man who is building to-day. The only purpose of
this chapter is to suggest to those who are building that they go
to a first-class house, pay a fair price, and get the best possible
apparatus regularly in the market.</p>

<p>The journey through the house is hardly complete until we
abandon the material view, and consider it from the standpoint
of beauty. As is said in another connection, the architect
does not do his full duty in making a house a model of convenience
and utility. The housekeeper always looks toward a
beautiful home, something that will be recognized for its beauty
and elegance. A house that is beautiful and attractive gives
pleasure to all who see it, as well as to the occupants. A beautiful,
artistic house is a source of education to the occupants.
A porch with clumsy columns, rude mouldings, heavy ceiling,
coarse details of all kinds, cannot but affect one&#8217;s living. One
that is fine in detail, generous in size, decorated in artistic spirit,
must of necessity not alone contribute to the comfort of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
who live in the house, but serve to lift them from that which
is common and ordinary. People may be surrounded by that
which is beautiful and artistic, and for a time fail to realize its
true excellence, or they may be surrounded with that which is
homely and crude without knowing the full measure of its
ugliness. The time must come, however, when the truth will
be realized to a certain extent. If it is in the direction of the
appreciation of what is beautiful, it must necessarily bring about
a higher state of mind. No man can walk across a front porch,
time after time, and take hold of a beautiful door, without being
affected by it. For this reason the vestibule, the front door,
and all that belongs to it, should be designed in a thoughtful
spirit, with the idea that it is the first of all things that will
impress those who enter the house. There may not be much
money to put into this door, but what there is may as well
bring something beautiful as something ugly. The same money
that will make an ugly detail will make a beautiful, artistic one.
If the glass of this door must be inexpensive, let it be the
ordinary cathedral glass. Instead of being brilliant in color,
select a soft, mild tint,&mdash;a light amber or a straw color. If
there are divisions in the door so that a number of sheets may
be used, two tints at most are all that are necessary. It is best
that they should be quiet in tone. If money is more abundant,
and an elaborate stained-glass design may be had, put the work
in the hands of an artist, one who is well known, and the result
cannot but be satisfactory. As to the door itself, nothing can
be nicer than natural wood, properly finished. The detail of the
design should be refined; there should be an avoidance of all
that is clumsy and heavy. The spirit of the interior may be
stamped upon this door. Where one cannot encompass the
expense of an artistically designed glass for the door or vesti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>bule
opening, a very pretty effect may be secured by the use of
a plain sheet of plate-glass; or, if desired, a slight additional
expense will give glass with bevelled edges. Sometimes this
bevelled glass is in small squares, with leaded joints. This
gives a very simple and rich effect from either side.</p>

<p>As one opens this door and steps into the vestibule, there
may come to his sight a beautiful mantel and grate-fire in the
reception-hall beyond. This is particularly beautiful when
shown through the folds of a tapestry curtain which separates
the vestibule from the reception-hall. Sometimes this vestibule
is arranged so that there is a small window at one side of it.
Nothing can be nicer than to have this filled with glass, of the
same general design as that of the door. The hooks for wraps
should be of polished brass, secured to a natural-wood strip.
An umbrella-stand of the same material is attractive. The floor
is best of hard wood, all but covered with a heavy rug. This is
a pleasant place to stop a moment, with a more beautiful view
beyond.</p>

<p>A reception-hall is, from an architectural standpoint, the
easiest room in the house to handle; that is, it can easily be
made to look well. This is because of its connection with the
vestibule, the stairway, the grate, often a window-seat, the large
openings into the other rooms, and the portières which go with
them. All these things combine well to make a pretty room.
Stairways, as now designed, are much more beautiful than those
made a few years ago. Then it was a habit to start at one end
of the hall and continue to the second floor in a single run, with
winders only at the upper end, to change the direction of the
movement. Now it is common to have at least two landings in
each run; oftentimes there will be only two or three steps, then a
landing, from which steps lead to another near the top. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
beginning of the stairway there are the newel posts, and at
each landing a corner post. This arrangement frequently
admits of the placing of a seat along one side of the outer part
of the lower landing. If not that, possibly one along the side
of the stairway, below the run of steps which starts from the
lower landing. The space between the railing and the steps is
usually occupied by turned balusters, though there are many
forms of filling and decorating this space. Sometimes it is of
turned spindle-work, scroll-work, fret-work, and squares or
panels, arranged in different forms.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to have stained-glass windows at each
landing. These windows are not necessarily large, and are
usually hung on hinges. Sometimes a small bay-window projection
is made from one or both of these landings. In them
may be placed seats, and in this way add beauty and convenience
to the room. It is quite usual to cover the reception-hall with
rugs rather than carpets. The hard-wood floor idea probably
had its origin in the reception-hall. If it ever takes its departure
it will be first from this room. If a hard-wood floor is not
largely covered with rugs it requires a great deal of labor.</p>

<p>The mantel in the reception-hall should be of wood. It is
pleasant to have the larger part of the entire setting made of
tile. These tiles are now made in most beautiful designs and
colorings. Beautiful figured designs may be had, if not for the
entire facing, for certain parts. It is not uncommon that only
a narrow margin of wood-work borders the sides of a mantel
of this kind. The shelf and cabinet above may be as ornamental
as desired. No treatment of wood-work can add to the beauty
of a large surface of tile facing. In some instances, no shelf
is provided; simply a bevelled facing, with a margin of woodwork,
not over an inch wide, to cover the joint where the tiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
comes in contact with the plaster. The hearth should be large.
The grate border is best of brass.</p>

<p>The walls of the reception-hall may have a gray plaster
finish, or be tinted or papered, as desired. The picture moulding
may come pretty well down from the ceiling; certainly not
higher than the tops of the doors. The part below may be
tinted in one color, and the upper, in another. The picture
moulding should always be of the same kind of wood as the
finish, and not gilded or treated in any other highly artificial
manner.</p>

<p>The openings into other rooms, even where sliding or
hinged doors are used, are frequently filled a short distance
from their top with what is popularly called fret-work. It may
be fret-work, pure and simple, or spindle-work, or simply scroll-work.
It is a very pleasing form of ornamentation. The curtains
come below. In one of the plans furnished, the entire
vestibule is made up of turned work, which, with a curtain, is
the only separation from the main hall. Sometimes arches are
decorated in the same manner, and the space between the circle
and frame is filled with these ornamental forms. A very simple
way of making screens is by the use of thin quartered oak-strips,
woven into basket patterns of ornamental form.</p>

<p>Only one general design of door and window casings is
shown in this book. There is no limit to the ornamental forms
which may be used in decorating casings of any kind. During
recent years, many ladies have used their energy and ability in
the direction of wood-carving, and, under competent instruction,
have done good work. For the most part, the patterns are in
low relief. The designs are frequently conventionalized, foliated
patterns. In the smaller communities it is hardly possible to get
good carving through ordinary channels, for the reason that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
there is not a sufficient amount of this kind of work to be done
to justify a high grade of talent in occupying so unprofitable
a field. It is unfortunately true, however, that very few workmen
who can carve at all, but have an idea that they do this
kind of work exceedingly well. No matter how crude their
efforts may be, there is no lack of self-appreciation. They profess
to be able to do that of which they are entirely ignorant.
It is best to be content with the simple mechanical forms
of interior wood-decoration, unless there are those of known and
recognized ability, who are capable of executing the more artistic
patterns.</p>

<p>Door and window casings are made much narrower and less
complex than was the custom several years ago.</p>

<p>The sitting-room of the lower floor is more clearly defined
by the term &#8220;living-room.&#8221; It is a room with much more wall
space than the reception-hall. It usually contains a grate and
mantel; has a large window to the front, and one on the side.
It is very nice if one of these windows can be arranged in the
form of a bay, with or without a window-seat. In the latter
case, it may serve the purpose of a conservatory in the winter
and a window-seat in summer. The use of large quantities
of stained glass in a sitting-room is objectionable. It is very
well to have a certain amount of it in the upper sash of some
of the windows. If the colors are mild, the effect upon the
atmosphere of the room is pleasant indeed&mdash;the light coming
through the soft amber or straw tints adds a mellowness and
richness to the light of the room, which is opposed to the colder
effects of light which comes through white glass. The mantel
of the sitting-room may contain a large number of compartments
in the form of small shelves, brackets, or cabinets, in which may
be placed bric-à-brac of various forms. A little cabinet on each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
side of a mantel, with a high door, is a very pretty feature. A
mirror between these cabinets gives a pleasing effect. This
mantel, like the one in the reception-room, should be of wood
with tile hearth and facings.</p>

<p>If this room is plastered in a gray finish, the walls may be
tinted in fresco colors, and, if desired, certain parts of it ornamented
by stencilling or otherwise. Unless this ornamental
work is done by an artist of recognized ability, it should be of
the simplest character. One or two simple lines, or a series of
short dashes, is much better than scrawling figures drawn by an
untrained hand. The ordinary fresco done by the foreign
artist is the ugliest, most ungraceful work possible. In the
larger cities, there are usually a few artists who do very beautiful
work, but the ordinary, cheap, conventional fresco stuff is
barbarous. Plain tinted walls are preferable to such glaring
monstrosities. There is not much risk, if one is careful in the
selection of colors; the part above the picture moulding may be
tinted differently from that below. There are very few people
but feel themselves competent to select colors for the interior
or exterior of a house. The fact is, there are very few who can
do it with any assurance of success. It is well for those who
have no special training in this line to pursue a safe plan in
the selection of tints for the walls and ceilings. This may be
done by choosing different shades of the same color for use
in the room. Say one begins with a terra-cotta body for the
part below the picture mould. That above the moulding may
be a lighter terra-cotta with a tendency to a buff. Then the
ceiling may be lighter still, or, to be entirely safe under almost
any circumstances, a gray with a leaning towards the color of
the wall. Other colors may be selected in the same way. Very
light, vivid blues have frequently been selected for ceilings, pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>sumably
because of the supposed resemblance to the sky. It is
certainly an illogical but by no means uncommon thought. Soft,
undecided grays are much pleasanter to those of quiet tastes.
There may be variations in it according to the character of the wall
decorations and surroundings. If one without special knowledge
wishes something more ambitious, he should consult some one
of acknowledged ability in this particular line. One cannot afford
to try experiments. Extremely beautiful wall decorations are
to be had in wall-paperings, and, while rather expensive, are
entirely satisfactory if carefully selected.</p>

<p>Very little more may be said about the sitting-room, excepting
to call to mind that a great deal depends upon the fittings
and furnishings of the room, which, however, should not be
glaring or rich. The quality of everything may be of the finest
and best, yet this room should essentially be quieter in tone
than the reception-hall or parlor, or even dining-room, which are
not in constant use. Anything which is rich and in any way
approaches the gorgeous is wearisome, and directly opposed to
the idea of a sitting-room.</p>

<p>The parlor may be merely a reception-room,&mdash;a room where
a lady may receive her callers in the afternoon, or the more
formal calls of ladies and gentlemen in the evening, or it may
be one room in addition to the others in the lower part of the
house. It may be the room which adds capacity to the lower
floor during times of general entertaining. In some cases,
particularly where the parlor is merely used as a reception-room,
it need not be large. In such a case it is merely a place
separated from the sitting-room, and in which to go for the
purpose of receiving friends in a room somewhat removed
from the slight confusion which may legitimately belong to
a sitting-room. The parlor is made distinctive in its appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>ance
from the sitting-room by its furnishings. It is not usual
to have any great difference in the design of the wood-work
in the different rooms of the lower floor. Generally
speaking, the doors are of the same design, and likewise the
casings, base, etc. The parlor belongs particularly to the society
life of the occupants of the house. It is not generally a family
room. It is removed from the ordinary home life except in
so far as the general social conditions draw all together. The
parlor, in its connection with the living-rooms of the house, and
the house itself, is entirely legitimate. There is a good deal of
sneering at the old parlor idea. This feeling has its origin in
the memory of the parlors of a few years ago,&mdash;those which
contained the one Brussels carpet, covered with red and green
flowers, furnished with black hair-cloth furniture, chairs arranged
around the wall in military style, a sofa&mdash;stiff of back and commanding
an attitude&mdash;in a most conspicuous position; walls
covered with coarse-figured, gilt paper, and rendered more
offensive by cheap, family portraits in oil, and elaborately framed
chromos.</p>

<p>The parlor of to-day is still a formal room; it does not
greatly differ from the older one in idea; it is the execution of
the idea which has changed. There is a greater refinement in
all the details; there is an artistic spirit which pervades everything.
There is harmony of color, quietness in tone. The
pictures are of a different character. The furniture is graceful
and comfortable. It is rarely separated from the other part of
the house. The doors leading into it are nearly always open.
Oftentimes there are only portières of tapestry or lace to
separate this room from the others which lead to it. It is a
room which is made necessary by the social life of the time.</p>

<p>The ideal parlor is a long room,&mdash;a large room. It is long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in proportion to its width. Sometimes there is an archway near
the middle, which suggests the division of the room into two
parts. There is a mirror at the end, and, lending dignity to
the room, there is the hall or library at one side. By its size, its
arrangement, its dignity, it is inspiring to a congenial company.
This is the ideal parlor, and the one of which the vulgarly
furnished parlor of a few years ago was a corruption. The
ideal parlor is shown in its completest original form in some
of the old mansions of the East and South. Some of the old
Virginia and Maryland houses carry out this idea in the completest
way. In Natchez, Miss., are houses built long before the
war, and designed by the French architects, which contain
parlors of splendid proportions and most artistic details. These
were designed in the purest classic architecture. The ceilings
were high, the paintings rich. All this is somewhat removed from
the common idea of a parlor as carried out at this time. However,
it is a pleasant thing to look back upon, or, when the opportunity
and means are at hand, a proper thing to enjoy in the reality.</p>

<p>The library, as now understood, is, in the ordinary house, a
room for books, papers, and magazines, in which the members
of the family may gather, who have use for that which it contains.
It should be a room which may be isolated from the
other parts of the house; a room in which one may study or
read or write, and have the quiet which belongs to such occupations.
A room which may be used as a passage from one part
of the house to another cannot be dignified by the name of
library. In such a room there must be quiet. There are very
few homes to which such a room would not be a material and
practical addition. There are times when nearly every one
desires the quiet and freedom from interruption which a room
of this kind affords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>It need not be a large room, but should contain all of the
paraphernalia of work: a desk, conveniently arranged, bookshelves
which are readily accessible, possibly portfolios arranged
along the walls, drawers with proper compartments, cases for
circulars and catalogues, and other &#8220;places for things.&#8221; The
nicest thing about book-cases is the books. Ornamental glass
doors and rich trappings add nothing to the beauty of the
library. People who make large use of books do not care to
have them protected by glass cases. The other furnishings and
fittings of a library should be quiet in tone, the chairs easy but
not rich, the carpet of a neutral color, the wall decorations
preferably without figured outlines, the pictures small and quiet.
Sliding doors between the library and any other room of the
house are not to be considered. Close-fitting doors on hinges
are proper. They exclude the sound. Sliding doors permit the
ready passage of sound, for the reason that they are more or
less open at top, bottom, middle, and sides. A low ceiling in a
library adds to the quiet and restful effect. One may have a
low ceiling in a library, even if they are higher in other rooms,
by studding down from above,&mdash;that is, putting in a false ceiling.
The expense is light indeed, and by such means additional
protection from the sounds above may be afforded.</p>

<p>The dining-room, in many houses, is the room in which the
entire family is gathered, perhaps for the only time during the
day. In this sense it is an assembly room. There is in this
busy country a growing respect for the social value of the
dining-room. In the family meetings at the table, there may
be an interchange of experiences that does not occur at other
times, for the reason that there is no opportunity for it. After
the meals the members of the family go to their various occupations,
and probably do not come together until another meal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
These facts may be considered in the planning of a dining-room.</p>

<p>We have thought of this room before in its mechanical
sense; we have looked at it through housekeeping eyes. We
have now to consider its artistic and social features. We look
at it as one of the family rooms. It has its shape or proportion
suggested to it from the table. It is oblong. The light coming
into it should be ample, but subdued in tone. It is pleasant, as
one enters a dining-room, to come into full view of a sideboard
which is decorated with that which belongs to this room in a
utilitarian way&mdash;its china, cut glass, and beautiful linen, than
which nothing can be more attractive.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant thing to have a conservatory attached to one
side or at a corner of the dining-room. The odor of flowers or
plants may not be agreeable constantly in a sitting-room. The
periodical occupation of the dining-room makes this pleasant
rather than otherwise. Most of the plans which are shown will
admit of the placing of a conservatory in connection with the
dining-room in the manner indicated.</p>

<p>The old English dining-room was large in its general proportions,
and heavy and rich as to its details; it was so large and
impressive that there was an offshoot which took form in a
breakfast-room. In our homes at this time we have the compromise.
Our habits of living do not demand the breakfast-room:
all come to breakfast together, and the requirement is
the same as for other meals.</p>

<p>Where one wishes to have a wood ceiling panelled or with
decorated beams, the dining-room, or the hall connecting with
it, may be chosen as the proper place to be treated in this
way. Where expense is not a great object, it is agreeable to
have a large part of the walls finished in wood. A wood finish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
one-half to two-thirds the height of the wall, and a ceiling of
wood above, with the intervening space finished in rough, tinted
plaster, gives a very pleasing effect. Projecting from the top
of the wood wall-finish may be a little shelf extending, say, five
inches beyond the wall. It may have a simple moulded edge.
In the top may be cut grooves; on the under edge may be
arranged, at regular intervals, cup hooks, which may be used in
part for suspending china, or, upon certain occasions, as a means
of securing floral decorations&mdash;say, a little train of ivy or smilax.
On the upper part of the shelf are placed pieces of china.
This shelf may be placed in any dining-room; if not around the
entire room, between two windows, or between the chimney
breast and the adjacent wall. Six feet from the floor is a good
height. If it is not overloaded, or if the idea is not generally
overworked, the effect will be very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The coloring of a dining-room may be a little heavier and
richer than that of the other rooms. A very pretty feature
which maybe introduced in a room of this kind is a china-closet,
which opens into the dining-room as well as into the china-room
adjoining. The dining-room side of the china-closet should be
glazed with clear glass above its lower section, and the china-room
or back side of the china-closet should be glazed with cathedral
glass of a semi-transparent character. There are doors on
hinges on each side. The drawers in the lower part, if provided,
open from both sides. If doors are used they should be
arranged in the same way, so that the lower shelves may be
approached from both dining-room and china-room. The glass
door on the dining-room side should not come down to the
shelf at the top of the lower section, but should be arranged to
leave an open space, as is indicated in the chapter on kitchens
and pantries. However, the doors on the china-room side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
this closet should come down, so as to cut off communication
between dining-room and china-room at will. This space between
the upper and lower section of the china-closet gives
space in which to set a tray, and, by opening a door on the
back, it acts as a slide between the china-room and dining-room.
This arrangement is not only very beautiful, but very
useful. See china-closet plan <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>, page 46.</p>

<p>The conservatory mentioned does not need to be in conventional
conservatory form, which usually has cheap glazing and
often common wood-work, but may be a bay-window with more
than an ordinary amount of glass, preferably plate.</p>

<p>The chambers and bedrooms, in their ideal form of arrangement,
have an abundance of light and sun, ample means for
ventilation, and a greater air of restfulness and airiness than
the rooms below. The carpets are in lighter tints, the walls
more nearly white, the windows not so heavily draped, the pictures
and frames of a lighter character, the chairs not so heavy
as those of the other rooms. From a chamber it is sometimes
desirable to have a bay window projecting from side or front.
It adds to the availability of the other floor space, affords additional
light and ventilation. Nothing can be nicer than a grate
fire in a bedroom. It should be surrounded with a wood mantel,
with tile facing and hearth. Above the mantel it is useful
to have a short plate-glass mirror. A dressing-case takes its
proper place on the side wall between two windows, or in a corner
with a window in each wall adjacent to it. Bedrooms are,
for the most part, lighted with brackets rather than central lights.
When attainable, a small dressing-room adds to the attractiveness
of a chamber.</p>

<p>In some houses there may be an alcove, a bay window, a
window-seat, a conservatory, or something of this kind, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
every principal room. These are features which add to the
beauty and attractiveness of the house. While all of these
things are not possible in every home, some one or two of them
may be attainable. In mentioning the various details which go
to make the beauty of a house, it is in mind that all these features
can be taken into account in but a very small proportion
of all the houses that are built, yet some one or more
of them may be used in every house, and thereby add to its
attractiveness.</p>

<p>It often happens when one gives especial attention to a
particular branch of a subject his neglect in other lines is
measured by the depth of his attention to the particular branch.
Matters which have to do with the utilitarian features of house-building
are considered in this work much more fully in the
text, than has the appearance of the buildings. It is desired that
this fact will not lead any one to believe that matters relating to
the appearance of the exterior have been neglected. Domestic
architecture is an old topic before the people. It is old in what
has been said in regard to the appearance of the buildings. The
subject, as a science to the architect, is new when considered
from the standpoint of convenience. The architectural student&#8217;s
dream is not of kitchens, pantries, closets, convenient
and economical arrangements of floor space, but is principally
of large public buildings, libraries, court-houses, and cathedrals.
When he descends to dwelling-houses, it is of something unique,
or odd,&mdash;something that is pretty or rich. When it relates to
details, it is hallways that are peculiar in their beauty, parlors
and sitting-rooms that are full of odd conceits. There has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
been a tendency toward strange things during recent years.
Matters of this kind have fed the fancy of many architects.
The housekeeper has been neglected.</p>

<p>Nothing attracts more attention than a beautiful house. It
is a pleasure to every one. It is as important to have a house
beautiful as it is that it should be convenient. The same education
and thoughtfulness that will enable an architect to design a
convenient house will make it beautiful. No one can be conscientious
in the consideration of the comfort of the housekeeper
and neglect the smallest detail leading to the beauty of
the house. The housekeeper lives in the hope of having a
beautiful home. It has been the purpose, in writing this book,
to bear all this in mind, and to add the element of convenience
to what has been said and done by others toward making beautiful
houses.</p>

<p>It costs no more to have a house beautiful than to have it
ugly. Beauty, like convenience, is largely a matter of thoughtfulness
and education. The only excuse for ugliness in house-building
is ignorance. The student of architecture has had
a great deal done for him. And, in considering that which
has to do with appearance, he has only to accept the advantages
of the best architectural schools and offices. Without these he
cannot expect to succeed. To be a designer of beautiful houses,
one must have had the same special training and advantages
that are necessary for success in other lines of professional work.
A physician must know the history of his profession, aside from
the more formal knowledge which leads him through his practice.
It is the same way with the student of architecture. The
successful designer of a small cottage will do better from having
a knowledge of the history of early architecture. Such a knowledge
is indispensable, in order to reach the best results. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
who has made a study of Greek architecture is much better
equipped to design a beautiful low-cost cottage, of four or five
rooms, than one who has not availed himself of these advantages.
He will make a better house for the same money. He
will do better work with simpler means. To take another
illustration: We may suppose that an architect has a porch to
design, and that the owner of the house does not have a great
deal of money to put in it. There are four turned columns, a
cornice, with a rafter finish, and underneath, a space in which
may be inserted a small band of inexpensive scroll-work. A
knowledge of the earlier architecture comes to his assistance
in a wonderful way. For the turning on the columns the
architect may select that from a column of the early English
Gothic architecture of the fourteenth century. These are
simple profiles, which can be turned at no greater cost, if the
drawing is furnished, than some crude, modern invention of the
turner or an uneducated designer. For the jig or scroll saw
work, he can arrange figures from some of the earlier ornamental
forms of the same period, and by drawing them full size the
scroll-sawyer can reproduce a beautiful design, which has a
history, with no more labor than he would give some corrupted
design which has filtered through the minds of careless house-builders.
For his rafter feet, this designer will have no difficulty
in recalling some simple form which has had a refined development.
This same line of procedure can be followed in all details
of house-building, and not add one dollar to the cost of the
structure. At the same time it brings about most beautiful
results,&mdash;the results of successful experience.</p>

<p>It may be said again that it takes no more money to make a
beautiful detail&mdash;one which has been the development of
experience and refinement&mdash;than it does something which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
clumsy and coarse. It requires, however, a knowledge of what
has been done,&mdash;a knowledge of the history of design. It
requires the faculty of using intelligently the results of the past,
not merely as they originally existed, but in their adaptation to
the wants and conditions of the present.</p>

<p>Several years ago Mr. Charles Eastlake wrote a book
entitled &#8220;Hints on Household Taste.&#8221; The book accomplished
a great deal, by merely leading people to think. To this day
there are a great many architectural features which, in the
builder&#8217;s parlance, go under the name of &#8220;Eastlake&#8221; designs.
There are so-called Eastlake doors, Eastlake frames, etc. In
truth, Mr. Eastlake had little to say about architecture in a
distinctive sense, and many evil things have been perpetrated in
his name. The best thing that Mr. Eastlake did was to teach
people that the furniture and other things which they had
around them could be beautiful and not expensive. That it was
not necessary to have a chair or a piece of wood-work loaded
down with something called ornament, in order to be beautiful.
After this people lost confidence in the furniture manufacturer,
and did not depend solely on the price of his wares as a measure
of their elegance or attractiveness. This was the sole work of
Charles Eastlake, with the masses of the people. He was a
missionary in his way. A man of no particular knowledge in
regard to architecture or design, yet one who was the means of
doing a great deal for architecture. He taught people to look
for beauty in simple things.</p>

<p>After a time came a certain something in domestic architecture
which was designated as the &#8220;Queen-Anne&#8221; style. We all
know what it is, yet it is difficult to describe. The veritable
Queen-Anne architecture meant something; the &#8220;Queen-Anne&#8221;
architecture of a few years ago meant anything&mdash;partic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>ularly
something that was pointed, erratic, and unusual. It,
however, did a good work. It enabled the architects to get out
of the old beaten paths. A great many beautiful houses were
built, which, by the public, were said to be in this style. The
name &#8220;Queen Anne&#8221; was the vehicle for the passage from an
old conservatism, which had to do only with the commonplace,
to something which was fresh and attractive. In this way a
great many beautiful houses were built during this so-called
Queen-Anne revival.</p>

<p>More recently there has been a movement toward the revival
of the old colonial architecture&mdash;a style that was developed by
a class of educated builders among the earlier settlers of this
country. Their knowledge was particularly of classic architecture
of the period of the Italian renaissance. A great many
strange and unusual things are being perpetrated in the name
of old colonial architecture at this time. At the same time, a
great deal that is beautiful and refined is being built in this
style. In the work of the very recent period which has to do
with this architecture, one may find a great deal of encouragement.
It shows a decided re-action from the extravagant crudeness
of the so-called Queen-Anne architecture, and in the end
we will reach something that is rational and beautiful.</p>

<p>Thus it is to be seen that, in whatever lines architecture is
moving, we shall find good work; that it is not so much the
style that it is named, as the resources of the designer:
resources which have to do with his education, and his disposition
to select that which is fine and beautiful&mdash;the sense which
leads him to discriminate.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>EVOLUTION OF A HOUSE-PLAN.&mdash;RESPECTABLE DIMENSIONS FOR A
MODERATE PRICE.&mdash;SIX PLANS.&mdash;COSTS, FROM $1,500 TO $2,600.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>The number of times that a house has been built indicates
the popularity of the plan. Plan <a href="#Plan_1">No. 1</a>, in one form or
another, has been used oftener than any other in the book.
Plans <a href="#Plan_1">Nos. 1</a>, <a href="#Plan_2">2</a>, and <a href="#Plan_3">3</a> are more frequently selected by people
who do not keep a servant. This arrangement makes a compact
and low-cost house. There is a porch over which the small
front bedroom extends on the second story. In Plan <a href="#Plan_1">No. 1</a> the
hall is seven and one-half by ten feet. There is a corner grate
for the living-room and the parlor. A stove might be used in
the dining-room in a way to moderate the temperature of the
entire lower floor.</p>

<p>There is one very large window opening into the dining-room.
It is a very pleasing thing to have the upper sash of the
dining-room glazed with simple colors of cathedral glass. This
glass gives a very pleasant tone to the light of the room, and, at
the same time, excludes the hot rays of the sun in summer. It
is possible to dispense with outside shutters when cathedral
glass is used in the upper sashes. A metal rod running across
the window on the inside, on a level with the horizontal
dividing-rail of the window, may be made to carry curtains
which will exclude the view from the outside. Thus, in the
glass, and by the aid of the curtains, we have much that might
be expected from the shutters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>There is a china-pantry between the kitchen and dining-room.
It is lighted by a small window at one side. It serves as a passageway
between these two rooms, and thus keeps the odor of
the cooking from the front part of the house. The pastry
pantry is immediately back of the china-pantry, and is entered
from the kitchen. It is also provided with a small window. In
the kitchen is a sink with a swinging table at one side, and room
for a portable table on the other. At one side of the sink may
be the cistern-pump, and on the other side the well-pump.
It should be placed back against the wall, and with handles
that are well out of the way when not in use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_1" name="Plan_1"></a>
<img src="images/plan_1.png" width="500" height="418" alt="Plan No. 1" title="Plan No. 1" />
</div>

<p>It is entirely unnecessary to place the pumps in the yards of
low-cost houses, as is so common. If a driven well is used, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
could be driven so as to be next to the kitchen sink. If it is a
dug well, it may be placed on the outside, and connected through
lead pipes with the sink on the inside. The cistern may be
connected in the same way. The entrance to the cellar stairs
is conveniently placed in one corner of the kitchen. The cellar
itself is under the sitting-room. The side-porch is large enough
to be used as a summer kitchen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_2" name="Plan_2"></a>
<img src="images/plan_2.png" width="500" height="409" alt="Plan No. 2" title="Plan No. 2" />
</div>

<p>It is to be noticed that there is no waste room in the upstairs
hall. There is merely wall space enough to admit of doors
leading into the various rooms. There is a small window which
lights this hall; the window may be reached for cleaning from
the stairway. This plan illustrates as clearly as possible the
advantage of having the main stairway land in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the house. There is no better way to economical use of space.
From the second-floor hall there is a stairway leading to the
attic. This passage is lighted in the same way as the second-floor
hall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_3" name="Plan_3"></a>
<img src="images/plan_3.png" width="500" height="420" alt="Plan No. 3" title="Plan No. 3" />
</div>

<p>It may be said that the bedrooms of this house are not large.
The house is not large. The problem involved a low-cost,
roomy house. We get a large number of rooms within a small
enclosure, and, necessarily, some of them are small. It is
to be borne in mind, however, that the value of a room is not
dependent upon its size. A room may be of respectable dimensions,
but yet not have the necessary wall space for the furniture.
Such a room would not be as satisfactory as a smaller one, had
care been taken to provide this space. In each bedroom there
should be space for a bed, a wash-stand, and a dressing-case.
The latter should be near a window. It will be found that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
is room for such furniture in each of the bedrooms shown on
this plan. All are provided with ample closets. In one of these
houses which was built, there was a door between the bedroom
in front and the chamber. In another case, there was a door
connecting the two larger rooms. All these things are matters
of personal preference, or special family requirements, depending
upon the age and number of the children, and other family
conditions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_4" name="Plan_4"></a>
<img src="images/plan_4.png" width="500" height="378" alt="Plan No. 4" title="Plan No. 4" />
</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_2">No. 2</a> is similar to <a href="#Plan_1">No. 1</a>, excepting that there are a few
changes in detail. The rooms are smaller; the hall is relatively
shorter; it illustrates the process of contraction. <a href="#Plan_3">No. 3</a> is similar
to <a href="#Plan_2">No. 2</a>, excepting that it has a front as well as a rear stairway,
and the position of the dining-room is changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span><a href="#Plan_4">No. 4</a> is a development of the same class of plans. There
are the front and the rear stairways, also a bath-room over the
kitchen, and a servant&#8217;s room. The dotted lines running
through the little bedroom on the second floor indicate the
position of a hall, which may be constructed connecting the
front and rear part of this house. As will be noticed, this is a
nine-room house in a very economical form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_5" name="Plan_5"></a>
<img src="images/plan_5.png" width="500" height="393" alt="Plan No. 5" title="Plan No. 5" />
</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_5">No. 5</a> is a further development and improvement of the
same idea. The objection that one may raise to any of the plans
just described is, that one has to pass through the parlor, or the
room in the rear of the hall, to reach the room back of the parlor.
Plan No. 5 solves this problem. From the hall we can go
into the living-room, the dining-room or parlor, without passing
through another room. The second floor is an improvement
over <a href="#Plan_4">No. 4</a>, in that the little bedroom in the rear is enlarged by
allowing it to project over the room below the width of the hall.
In the rear of this comes the bath-room.</p>

<p>As to cost. The building, without appurtenances, on the
basis outlined in schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; would cost as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Plan No. 1, $1,700; No. 2, $1,550; No. 3, $1,550; No. 4,

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_6">No. 6</a> had its origin in Plan <a href="#Plan_1">No. 1</a>, and was developed
through the successive stages indicated in the description of
plans from 1 to 5 inclusive. The position of the grate-stack has
been changed, so that it acts for the reception-hall on one side,
and the parlor on the other. The reception-hall, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a><br /><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
receding, projects. In one corner thereof is arranged a vestibule,
partitioned from the rest of the rooms by ornamental
fret-work backed with curtains. This will make a very beautiful
feature. It changes this hall into a room. From here we
may pass to the parlor, sitting-room, and dining-room. In the
rear of the sitting-room is a porch; at one side, a projecting
window-seat. The sitting-room closet is cut off from the pantry.
The dining-room is connected with the sitting-room by sliding-doors.
A convenient china-closet connects the dining-room
and kitchen. On one side of the china-room are arranged
drawers. Under the china-closet proper are shelves enclosed
by panelled doors; the china-shelves above being protected by
glass doors, according to the general ideas previously expressed
when considering the china-closet in particular. The kitchen is
the same as others, which are described elsewhere in a more
detailed way. There is a laundry in the basement, and an outside
cellar-way connecting with the back yard. The inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
cellar-way is shown. The next door is that which leads to the
second floor. There are five bedrooms on this floor. The elevation
of this house is shown in Fig. <a href="#Fig_11">No. 11</a>. The building,
without appurtenances, according to schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; costs $2,600.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>A SMALL POCKET-BOOK AND A LARGE IDEA.&mdash;AMBITION, DOLLARS,
AND A GOOD HOUSE.&mdash;THE GROWTH OF THE HOUSEKEEPER&#8217;S
IDEAS.&mdash;POINTS ABOUT THE HOUSE.&mdash;$2,900.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>It is frequently said of those who would build, that their ideas
are larger than their pocket-books. It is certainly not discreditable
to any one that his ideas should be larger than his
immediate resources. Such a condition causes the enlargement
of the individual and his pocket-book at the same time. The
man who says that he wants two thousand dollars&#8217; worth of
house does not get as much for his money as he who in effect
says, &#8220;I want three thousand dollars&#8217; worth of house for two
thousand dollars.&#8221; The latter is an ambitious man; the former
has only a little ambition. He merely wants a house. Fortunately,
however, there are few such people. It is more
likely to happen that a man and his wife, who have worked
hard for several years, get enough money together to build a
home, and it is possible that this home has been talked about
for several years previous to their building. In fact, they have
been educating themselves in house-building. They have
acquainted themselves with all of the modern conveniences.
They have studied porches, vestibules, and stairways; they know
how many rooms they want on the first floor and the bedrooms
that they will have above. At first this house presents itself in
a very crude form; but in the course of time the plan shows
itself more clearly to them. They begin to place the furniture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in the imaginary rooms, and as they do this their ideas enlarge.
They add at first inches, and then feet, to the size of the various
rooms. At first their ideas of a kitchen were quite moderate;
in time a sink begins to assume certain vague outlines, then it
takes definite form on one side of the room; then a pump is
placed beside it; afterward the wife says, &#8220;How nice it would
be if we could have a hot-water faucet over the sink.&#8221; At first
they shake their heads and say that it would cost too much; but
in the course of a few evenings&#8217; talk on this and kindred
subjects, they come to the conclusion that if the hot-water
arrangements do not cost too much, they will have them; and
that as things are so much cheaper than they used to be, they
certainly ought to get all of these for about what they originally
expected to pay for the house. Their ideas have been of slow
growth, but continuous, and in the aggregate the growth has
been great. During all the winter months, previous to the
time when they would build in the spring, many sketches are
made, of the floor-plans of the house that is to be. Finally
the net result is handed to a builder or an architect,&mdash;more
frequently the former, as most small houses are built without
professional service. The figures from the builder come in,
and are very much higher than was expected. It is quite a
shock, for certainly there is nothing there that they can well do
without. Everything has been thought of so much. Nothing
that their plan contains appears to them to be less than a matter
of necessity. Other builders are asked to figure with results
little more satisfactory. In the end there must be a compromise;
the builder and the owner both yield, and, as a result, a very
satisfactory house is built. There are little things which they
would have different, but, in the main, the house is satisfactory.</p>

<p>This is the universal experience, and the effect upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
domestic architecture of this country has been very pronounced.
We can now get a better house for a given sum of money than
ever before. Better not only as to general construction, but as
well on account of external appearance, and the convenience of
its internal arrangements. One may get more of what are
regarded as the little conveniences, which mean so much to the
housekeeper. This is not altogether the result of lower prices
of the material and labor which go to make a house, but is as
well on account of the skill which has been developed in planning
and arranging buildings, with reference to economy in
space, and cost of general construction. The planning of
houses has undergone a revolution within a few years past; and
instead of having the long, narrow halls at the side and in the
middle of a house, and the long halls and narrow passages
through the upper floor, all of which was ugly and inconvenient,
we now have the same area thrown in large square rooms, so
as to be available.</p>

<p>It may be known that chimney stacks are quite expensive.
For this reason an effort has been made to group them, so that
they may be made to answer for a number of rooms; and the
success with which efforts in this direction have been attended
has been wonderful indeed. The modern floor plan is altogether
different from that of the past; it is more convenient and less
expensive to build; and, as said before, this is largely the result
of efforts of the owner, who has ideas larger than his pocket-book,
and the architect or builder, who exercises his ingenuity
to bring the ideas and the money together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_7" name="Plan_7"></a>
<img src="images/plan_7.png" width="500" height="336" alt="Plan No. 7" title="Plan No. 7" />
</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_7">No. 7</a> is of an eight-room house, and is fairly representative
of the ideas expressed. The general form, it will be seen,
is square. It is a two-story house with a reception-hall, parlor,
dining-room, kitchen, china-closet, pantry, and stair-hall on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
first floor; there are three chambers, the servant&#8217;s bedroom,
the bath-room, and a communicating hall on the second floor.
The first floor is ten feet six inches high, and the second, nine
feet six inches. From the second floor there is a stairway going
to the attic, which is large and roomy, and which may have various
uses. The cellar is seven feet high, and is well lighted by
having the joist set well up from the grade line. There may be
a laundry here, and, separated from it by a door, we may have a
coal-cellar and a furnace-room. As we approach the house,
there is, first, a broad porch about eight feet in width, and
fourteen feet in length. At a slight additional expense, say fifty
dollars to sixty dollars, this porch might be extended across the
entire front. Before reaching the front door, there is a small
vestibule,&mdash;arranged with or without storm-doors, as may be
thought desirable. It is the impression of the writer that storm-doors
are seldom used. The distinctive feature of this house is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the hall, which is large enough&mdash;thirteen feet six inches by fifteen
feet&mdash;to be used as a sitting-room. In the front part of
this hall, and at the right as we enter, are a window-seat and a
broad window in front and immediately above it; this is slightly
separated from the main room by the small pilasters or casings
on each side. Immediately in front of the doorway, there are a
grate and mantel set in one corner of the room. There are large
doorways, five feet wide, leading into the stair-hall immediately
back of this room, and into the parlor at the left as we enter.
In this case there are merely door openings, portières or curtains
taking the place of ordinary doors. Sliding-doors might
be used in addition to the curtains, and thus have the advantage
of both curtains and doors. From this room the outlines of the
stair-hall and the stairway are visible or not, according to the
arrangement of the portières. There is a side entrance into this
hall, and from it one may go into the kitchen by passing through
two doors. It is a good principle in planning a house always to
have two doors between the kitchen and any other part of the
house. One door could as well be used in this instance, but
a second one is added to make the isolation more complete.
In the plan here given, it may be noticed that there are cellar
stairs passing under the main stairway in the hall.</p>

<p>The dining-room may be entered either from the front parlor
or from the stair-hall. In each case doors are used. It is
always desirable to have a dining-room so arranged that it may
be closed from the other parts of the house. There is a grate
in each of the two principal rooms, the hall, the parlor, and the
dining-room, and all communicate with a single stack. This is
much more economical than having three distinct stacks, which
are so frequently used for accomplishing the same result. The
only other chimney stack is in the kitchen. The two answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
every purpose. The outside corners of the dining-room are cut
off at an angle of forty-five degrees, so that the end of the dining-room
presents the form of a large bay window. In the middle
space at this end may be placed the sideboard, in which event
a window will be placed over it,&mdash;that is, well toward the ceiling.
The dining-room communicates with the kitchen through a large
pantry, eight feet square, or through a slide in the back of the
china-closet. In the kitchen there are broad windows on the
two sides, and a door leading into the back yard.</p>

<p>In following the stairway to the second floor, it will be noticed
that there is a broad landing something more than half-way up,
and that there is a large window, slightly above it, which lights
the hall below, and partially lights the one above. The advantages
of having a stairway which lands approximately in the centre
of the house, as does this one, is that no room is lost by
having long halls which have to lead from the front to the rear
of the house. All we need have is a short hall in the centre of
the building, which will communicate with the rooms around it.
Another convenience of this arrangement is that all of the front
of the house is utilized for chambers. Where the stairway lands
in the front of a house, there must either be a long hall, which
is a waste of room, or one must pass through one or more
chambers to get to others. In this plan the rooms are arranged
around the hall, there being three large ones over the three
principal rooms below. In each of these chambers there is
abundant space for the usual bedroom furniture,&mdash;viz., a bed,
dresser, wash-stand, and chairs. In these rooms there are closets,
and at the end of the hall there is a store closet for bedding,
etc. The servant&#8217;s room, as shown, is over the kitchen, as is
also the bath-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_12" name="Fig_12"></a>
<img src="images/fig_12.png" width="500" height="484" alt="Fig. 12" title="Fig. 12" />
</div>

<p>It may be noticed that the fixtures in the bath-room&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
is, the bath-tub and closet&mdash;are directly over the sink below,
so that the pipes may have the most direct and the shortest runs
possible, which is not only economical, but also safer from
flooding in case of accident. The tank in the attic, which contains
the soft or cistern water, is directly over the tub, and the
laundry sink in the cellar is directly under the kitchen sink.
Thus, from cellar to attic, all the plumbing fixtures are in line,
and all pipes exactly vertical, excepting where it is desirable
to take a short branch to connect the fixtures. Having the
bath-room slightly separated, as it is, from the main hall, it is
safer, from a sanitary point of view, than if it opened directly
into the main hall. There is a closet for soiled linen next to the
bath-room, which is accessible either from it or from the short
hall leading to it. The stairs to the attic lead out of the hall, as
shown. The attic is floored, but is otherwise unfinished. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
found desirable, one or more rooms could be finished here, which
would be quite as large and pleasant as any of the other rooms
in the house. This house can be finished complete, including
fences, sheds, walks, gas fixtures, plumbing, mantels, and
furnace, for $2,900.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>&#8220;WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT.&#8221;&mdash;A CONVENIENT PLAN.&mdash;MEETING
THE WANTS OF PEOPLE WHO BUILD.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Floor plans develop from the varying necessities of those
who build. There is no reason why the same arrangement
should suit any large number of people. A floor plan, if carefully
and thoughtfully made, will meet the requirements of the
individuals whose wants are particularly considered. While
there are certain general principles, which affect the value of a
floor plan for good or evil, the detailed requirements are almost
as varied as the tastes and dispositions of the occupants.</p>

<p>A lady and gentleman come into an architect&#8217;s office, and
explain that they are intending to build, and want to look at
something with a view of selecting a plan. The architect has
a great many plans which he might show them, but he knows
well enough that none of them will be selected. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to show you anything I have, but not with
the expectation of finding something that will please you. By
doing so, I shall probably find out what you do not want, and
in that negative way meet your requirements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know what we want,&#8221; says the lady, &#8220;but I do
not know just how to arrange it. The stairways bother me, and
there are things which I do not get to suit me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tell me what, you want, and then we will make a
sketch; and from that, corrections; and, in the end, we shall
probably have something satisfactory, though not wholly so at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>&#8220;Before we go any farther,&#8221; says the gentleman, &#8220;I want to
say that we have only twenty-five hundred dollars to put into
a house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is all we can afford,&#8221; says the lady; &#8220;but I can
tell you what we want.&#8221;</p>

<p>The architect reaches for a note-book and a piece of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want a reception-hall, with a grate and stairway in it.
There must be a small vestibule, with a place for overshoes, hats,
and overcoats. Somewhere near the reception-hall, or in it,
I want a closet where I can put my own wraps, and those of
the children, and other things which I do not care to keep
upstairs, and yet wish to have out of the way. It does not need
to be a large closet, but must not be unusually small. We want
a parlor and dining-room, which connect with the reception-hall.
The parlor will be used as a sitting-room not a little, but not in
the ordinary way, for the reason that I stay upstairs with the
children most of the time. I do my sewing there. If I should
use the parlor regularly as the sitting-room, I could receive my
callers in the reception-hall. It would be nice if we could have
some kind of a window-seat in that room. We want a grate in
the sitting-room, but not necessarily one in the dining-room.
I want a back stairway, but it must not go up directly from
the kitchen. The kitchen and pantry I want you to make as
convenient as possible in a house of this cost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would a combination stairway do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want that at all. It would be bringing the two
together. I want the rear stairway in the rear of the house, and
entirely separate from the one in front. It should land near
the girl&#8217;s room on the second floor, so that it can be cut off from
the rest of the house. We must have plenty of closet-room
upstairs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>&#8220;How many children have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two: a baby and a little boy about six years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must have at least four bedrooms,&#8221; was suggested.
&#8220;For the present, the baby can sleep in your room,
and the boy in a room next to and connecting with it. There
must also be a guest&#8217;s room and a servant&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that will have to do for the present; but don&#8217;t forget
the bath-room, and be sure to have plenty of closets. There
is one thing I had almost forgotten. There must be some
arrangement so that the servant can get from the kitchen to
the front door without going through the dining-room; but
we don&#8217;t want the smells of the kitchen to get into the front
part of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>After two or three sketches had been made, the result, as
here illustrated, was reached. The architect has it in mind that
the space at the right of the entrance door in the vestibule
would serve as a place for overcoats and other winter equipments.
He suggests that a portière be placed between the
vestibule and the opening leading into the reception-hall. This
will prevent draughts of cold air from making their way into
the front room when the door is opened. It will also lend
a certain amount of privacy. The porch is placed in front, as
a matter of course. In the recess of the hall which is made
by the vestibule a window-seat is placed. In the rear of the
reception-hall is the closet required. As a means of getting
from the kitchen to the reception-hall without passing through
the dining-room, two doors are arranged leading to a passage
under the stairs. This will prevent the passage of kitchen
odors over the house. The parlor and dining-room are
arranged as shown. Between the window and the door leading
to the china-closet is space for the sideboard. The pantry is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
separated from the china-closet by the cupboard of the former.
It has doors above and shelves below. The ice-chest is placed
in the pantry. It is readily accessible from both china-closet
and kitchen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_8" name="Plan_8"></a>
<img src="images/plan_8.png" width="500" height="427" alt="Plan No. 8" title="Plan No. 8" />
</div>

<p>The passageway to the second floor is from this room, and,
considering the limited means and large general requirements,
this arrangement will no doubt be satisfactory. The stairway is
accessible from both dining-room and kitchen. As there is a
bath-room and water-closet above, there is no necessity for
carrying slops downstairs and through the kitchen. The kitchen
has the usual fittings. The passage to the cellar is under the
front stairway. As will be remembered, there is a door shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>ting
this passage from the reception-hall. Upstairs there is
a closet in each room, two opening into the hall&mdash;one for
bed linen, and one for dust-pans, brushes, etc. There is also
a closet in the bath-room. The attic stairway is shown. An
inspection of Plan <a href="#Plan_8">No. 8</a> will show how all of the requirements
were met.</p>

<p>Cost, as per schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; $2,200.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>TWO GOOD ROOMS IN FRONT.&mdash;THE COMBINATION PANTRY.&mdash;TOO
MUCH CELLAR A BURDEN.&mdash;$2,500.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>In Plan <a href="#Plan_9">No. 9</a>, the reception-room contains the front stairway.
This stairway lands near the front of the house on the second
floor, for which reason we are enabled to have in the front part
of the house the two rooms which are most used on each floor.
We have the two chambers above, and the reception-room and
the sitting-room below. If we had a long, narrow stair hall constructed
in the usual way, we should have the sitting-room
towards the rear, and only a little alcove bedroom over the hall
in front.</p>

<p>The dining-room, which is a large room, is connected with
the front part of the house by sliding-doors. It has a grate in
one corner of it. On general principles, a grate has no business
in the dining-room. It is nearly always at some one&#8217;s back, and
makes him uncomfortable at meal time. Being in the corner of
the room, it is farther from any one than it would be if located
on a side wall: hence it may be allowed. There is a porch in
the rear of the dining-room, and between the door leading to
it and the door to the china-closet there is a space for a side-board.
There are two windows at the end of this dining-room.
The door which passes into the pantry should be on double
spring-hinges, so that it will swing both ways. One can push
against it and open from either side, and when it is released it
will take its natural position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_9" name="Plan_9"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>The pantry is a large one. Pantries, in general, may be
regarded as a kitchen annex&mdash;a store-room and preparing-room.
This pantry is on the combination plan. It connects with the
china-closet by means of a slide. Aside from this china-closet,
which projects into it, there is a cupboard with double doors at
one end, a flour-bin at the side, a pastry table next to it, and a
refrigerator by the window. One reason for placing this refrigerator
near the window is, that a flight of steps and a platform
might be arranged on the outside, so that the iceman could put
in the ice without going through the kitchen. We go down
cellar from this pantry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<a id="Fig_13" name="Fig_13"></a>
<img src="images/fig_13.png" width="412" height="500" alt="Fig. 13" title="Fig. 13" />
</div>

<p>There is a cellar under about half of this house&mdash;the
kitchen and the dining-room. It should have a cemented floor,
and numerous windows for lighting it. The part under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
kitchen could be used for a laundry, that under the dining-room
for coal storage and furnace. There could be an excavation
under a part of the sitting-room for vegetable storage. &#8220;Why
not put a cellar under the whole house? It would cost but
little more,&#8221; has been asked many times. It is the little things,
the smaller economies, in a building of this kind which makes
the difference between an expensive house and a house of
moderate cost. Every foot of cellar space beyond what is
needed for actual use is a burden to the housekeeper. The
arrangement has more to do with the number of apartments than
with the amount of space. We have a laundry-room, a place
for furnace and fuel, and a room for vegetables, which is about
all that can be used. From the cellar we can go up the stair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>way
and into the kitchen, from the kitchen to the second floor,
and from the second floor to the attic.</p>

<p>It is a large attic, a place for large rooms if one should
need them. Under any circumstances this attic should be
floored. There could be no better place for general storage,
and at times for drying clothes.</p>

<p>It seldom happens that two houses from exactly the same
plan are built. While this plan has pleased many people, there
are others who would not be attracted by it; who would not
care to build this house as their home. The universal floor
plan has never been made, and never will be. There are general
principles running through all plans which are valuable,
and if rightly understood will contribute to the improvement
of the homes of the people.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>SITTING-ROOM AND PARLOR IN FRONT.&mdash;A CONNECTING VESTIBULE.&mdash;A
CENTRAL COMBINATION STAIRWAY.&mdash;GOOD ROOMS IN THE
ATTIC.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>When we say that the sitting-room should be in the front
part of the house, it does not necessarily imply that the
parlor should be disturbed. As shown in Plan <a href="#Plan_10">No. 10</a>, they
may both be in front. The vestibule, which is large enough for
a hat-rack, and for the occupants of the house to stand while
putting on their overshoes and wraps, is in front of both parlor
and reception-room, but yet in a way so as not to disturb the
view to the street from either of these rooms. We cannot have
all of the rooms in front. The kitchen we do not want there.
The dining-room is convenient if placed immediately in the rear
of the sitting-room. Thus we have two rooms in front and two
in the rear. This is practically a square house. The old habit
has been to place the stairway along one side of the parlor in the
hall which served as a passageway from the front to the rooms
immediately in the rear. This distribution of halls is what has
thrown the sitting-room back of the parlor. In the plan here
given the change has been made so that the hall has relatively
the same position that did the sitting-room in the past, though
it is by no means as large. It is essentially a stair-hall, and
incidentally a passage. As placed, we may enter it from
the parlor, sitting-room, dining-room, or kitchen. Its position
is central. There are two doors between this stair-hall and the
kitchen. The central position of the stairway has other advan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>tages
than those just stated. It makes long halls on the second
floor entirely unnecessary. As will be seen by looking at the
floor plan, it gives two good bedrooms in front.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_10" name="Plan_10"></a>
<img src="images/plan_10.png" width="500" height="440" alt="Plan No. 10" title="Plan No. 10" />
</div>

<p>The dining-room is immediately in the rear of the sitting-room.
There may be sliding doors connecting these two rooms.
One door, three and a half feet wide, usually makes a sufficiently
large opening for the dining-room connection. There
are sliding doors between the parlor and sitting-room, and
dining-room and sitting-room, as shown. The kitchen has the
advantage of a certain amount of isolation from the rest of
the house, for the reason that there are two doors between it
and any other room. The pantries are arranged with reference
to their most convenient use. In the kitchen-pantry there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
places for a refrigerator, flour-bin, bread-board, and cupboard.
The dining-room pantry is a china-closet, with glass doors
above and closed doors below. The doors connecting the
dining-room pantry or passage should be hung on double-spring
hinges.</p>

<p>In the plan of this house it is shown how we may go from
the kitchen to the same landing that is used for the main stairway,
and thus avoid the necessity for a distinctively back hall
and back stairway. However, if it is so desired, it is easy to
place a stairway in the rear, and thus have them entirely independent.
In that event a room may be placed over the pantry,
and be used by the servant. This part of the house could be cut
off from the front rooms and the bath-room on the second floor
by a door. But to take the house as it is, we have a combination
stairway, there being two doors separating the kitchen
approach from the common landing in the main stair-hall.</p>

<p>On the second floor there is a hall about fourteen feet long
from which we pass to two bedrooms in front, two in the rear,
the bath-room and the store-closet. Each room is independent.
They may be connected one with the other as family necessities
suggest. The store-closet is accessible from the hall, as such
a closet should be. This makes it available from any of the
rooms. The bath-room is directly over the kitchen.</p>

<p>In each bedroom there is a place for a bed, a dressing-case,
and a wash-stand, which is not always the case in bedrooms.
If there is a place for these things, if the dressing-case bears its
proper relation to the sources of light, if it is so placed that the
light from the window or from the gas shines in the face of the
user, if the wash-stand is conveniently disposed, and there is
room at the side of it for a slop-jar, if there is a large closet,
then the architect has done his full duty in the arrangement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the bedroom. The room that is called the family room should
be especially well cared for in the matter of closets.</p>

<p>A hundred dollars would lath and plaster the entire attic of
this house, and provide a room in the front part which could be
used by the boys or the servant. There is no objection to
this except in the necessity for climbing an extra pair of stairs.
The mere mention of a bedroom in the attic is distasteful to
many people. It arouses memories of hot, dusty, and uncomfortable
places in which they have passed the night. All this
depends on the attic. The roof in this house is pitched at an
angle of forty-five degrees. The house at the narrowest point
is 29. feet wide. This would make the attic at the highest
point 14&frac12; feet. We can stud down from this and have a nine-foot
story and at the same time a large room, one which would
have none of the disadvantages of a half-story room, and which
would have all the advantages of a well-ventilated, comfortable
bedroom, for summer or winter. The plastering of the attic
suggests neatness. Having it well lighted by dormers exposes
all disorder. Cost, as per schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; $2,600.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>A COMPACT PLAN.&mdash;AN ISOLATED RECEPTION-ROOM.&mdash;COMBINATION
STAIRWAY.&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF THE FLOOR PLAN.&mdash;CELLAR ARRANGEMENT.&mdash;DINING-ROOM
AND CONSERVATORY.&mdash;ANOTHER
PLAN.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>The floor plans in <a href="#Plan_11">No. 11</a> are of a house of small area,
30 &#215; 34&frac12; feet, for body of the structure. There is a
porch in front, a circular bay window at one side, and a pantry
and china-closet projecting at the rear. In the house there are
eight available rooms besides the bath-room and the attic. In
the attic, rooms quite as liberal as any in the house could be
constructed at a small expense.</p>

<p>On the first floor, as we enter, there is the reception or
sitting hall, which is so common in the more modern arrangements
of dwellings. This reception hall or room has a certain
amount of isolation from the passage which leads from the vestibule
to the stairway and the rear portion of the house. It
may be separated therefrom by curtains or portières. It would
be entirely possible to separate the two by means of sliding
doors, in which event the opening from the room into the
passage would have to be a little narrower than shown in the
drawings. This room could be used as the office of a physician,
or of a gentleman who did more or less business at home.
By making the front vestibule about six inches deeper, a separate
entrance to this room could be provided. In this event, a
door from the room into the passage leading to the living part
of the house would be a necessity. The circular bay end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
this room would present an attractive feature. The windows in
this part of the room could be placed about four feet from the
floor, in which event book-shelves could be arranged below
them. The window in front goes to within seventeen inches of
the floor. Under the stairway, and leading from this room,
may be placed a very liberal closet, in which there should be
a small window.</p>

<p>Leading from the passage is the stairway, and two closets.
The little passage in which one closet is placed is separated
from the hall by a door. There is another door opening from
this passage into the kitchen. Thus there are two doors
between the kitchen and the front part of the house. This
arrangement has in mind the isolation of the kitchen from the
other rooms in a way to prevent the passage of the usual
kitchen odors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_11" name="Plan_11"></a>
<img src="images/plan_11.png" width="500" height="380" alt="Plan No. 11" title="Plan No. 11" />
</div>

<p>The stairways in this house are of the class known as combination
stairways; while they are convenient and easy of construction,
there is a certain amount of complication in their
arrangement which makes them difficult of description so as to
be understood by those not accustomed to examining floor plans.
There is the stairway from the front hall to the floor above, and
one from the kitchen to the landing of the front stairway. The
landing of the front stairway and that from the kitchen stairway
is in common; that is, it is the same. For the purpose of
making this understood, it may be well to say that one may go
up the stairway from the front hall to the landing, some eight
steps, and from thence down into the kitchen, or he can
turn right face and go to the landing on the second floor. This
part of the stairs is used coming up from the kitchen as well
as from the front hall. However, the kitchen stairway is separated
from the landing by a door. There is another door at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the foot of this kitchen stairway. In coming downstairs, one
may turn to the right, open a door, and go down into the
kitchen; or, he may turn to the left, and go down the front
stairway into the hall. Thus it will be seen that the combination
stairway is a front and rear stairway together, with separate
entrance from both parts of the house,&mdash;one from the kitchen,
and one from the front hall. It must be confessed that there
is a certain amount of compromise in an arrangement of this
kind, but it is a saving of both space and money, and is tolerable
on this account. By this plan everything is concentrated, and
without the serious drawback which extra cost, or a smaller number
of rooms, would imply to those who have only a little over two
thousand dollars to spend for a house, without appurtenances.
The head room for the stairway, coming up from the kitchen, is
secured under the bath-tub in the bath-room immediately above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>The cellar stairway is clearly indicated as going down parallel to the
kitchen stairs and under the front stairs. The cellar in this house
should be under the kitchen, stairways, and the reception-hall; that is,
it would occupy all of one side of the house. In this cellar plan the
principles set forth in the previous chapter on cellars are carried out.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/illo_1.png" width="225" height="300" alt="Cellar plan" title="Cellar Plan" />
</div>

<p>The parlor is thirteen and one-half by seventeen feet in size. It is
connected with a hall by wide sliding doors, so that about one-half of
this side of the room may be open. The grate opposite the sliding doors
in the parlor would present a very beautiful view from the hall and
stairway. The sliding doors between the parlor and dining-room are
placed there more in deference to custom than through any personal sense
of their fitness. Sliding doors do not have the quality of excluding
sound or odors that is desirable. The ordinary hinged door is better in
this respect. This room which would commonly be called a parlor would
really be used as a living-room, excepting by those who use the
dining-room or one of the second-floor chambers for that purpose.</p>

<p>Our dining-room has an independent connection with the
front hall, so that we do not have to go through the parlor or
the sitting-room to reach it. A little extra money, say seventy
dollars, would place a conservatory at one side, at one corner,
or at the end of this dining-room. Fifty dollars would give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
bay window. As it is, we have two windows of the ordinary
kind at one side of the room, and none at the end. A very
good arrangement, when bay or conservatory is not used,
would be to take one of these windows at the side and place it
at the rear end, though near the outside corner of the room.
This would give space between the windows and the china-closet
door for a sideboard. The window at the side of the
dining-room, if the other were moved to the end, should be
in the middle of the wall space; that is, opposite the centre
of the flue.</p>

<p>From the dining-room we go into the kitchen through the
china-pantry, which is marked &#8220;passage.&#8221; This china-pantry
has a little window at one side, and at the end a separate apartment
for chinaware, which is closed from the passage by means of
glass doors. The doors leading from the passage into the dining-room
and kitchen should be hung on double-swinging hinges.</p>

<p>There are those who would say that there should be no door
from the kitchen into the passage leading from the dining-room
to the front hall. It would probably be well to retain this door
in this position, and have a bolt on the side of the door toward
the hall. Thus the mistress of the house can close it, and keep
it closed at will. Another thing that might be done would be
to place a strong spring on this door which would always keep
it closed. The windows in this kitchen should be placed about
three feet from the floor, so that tables may be placed under
them. There is a place for a gas-stove between the two windows,
or even under them if desirable. The porch at the rear
of the kitchen may be enclosed with lattice work, or, what is
better, coarse louvered slats, like those of a shutter. In either
event, it could be covered with screen wire, and made a part of
the kitchen in summer. In the plan, however, nothing of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
kind is indicated. The door which leads from the porch into
the pantry is a small one, placed above the ice-chest, and is for
the use of the ice-man.</p>

</div>

<p>The arrangement of rooms upstairs will be readily understood.
Leading out of the hall is a store closet for bedding,
etc. It is located so as to be accessible from all rooms. From
the front end of the hall a door leads into the stair passage to
the attic.</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_12">No. 12</a> is the outgrowth of Plan <a href="#Plan_11">No. 11</a>. In it there is
a lift running from cellar to attic, as shown. The only important
difference between it and No. 11 is in the size of the library.
Cost, as per schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; $2,600. <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a> is an elevation: see

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR $1,600?&mdash;THE CLOSET IN THE HALL.&mdash;A
SMALL CONVENIENT KITCHEN.&mdash;CLOSETS IN THE BEDROOMS.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>This house&mdash;Plan <a href="#Plan_13">No. 13</a>&mdash;was finished at a cost of less
than $1,600. This included, besides the house itself, a
woodshed, well, and cistern. There is a cellar under the hall
and parlor. The building has a brick foundation, and the wood-work
begins two feet above the grade. The stud-walls of the
exterior are lined, first with dressed sheathing, then with heavy
building-paper, and finally covered with weather-boarding. The
first and second tiers of joists are two by ten inches; the ceiling-joists
of the second story are two by eight inches. All of
the studding is two by four inches. The windows have box
frames with iron weights and cotton cords. The first story
is ten feet high, the second eight and a half feet. These
details of construction are mentioned so that any one interested
may know that it is a substantial, well-constructed building.
The interior finish is of pine, part of which is varnished and the
remainder stained and varnished. The front door and stairway
are of quartered oak.</p>

<p>The front porch is 10&frac12; feet wide and 7&frac12; feet deep. It has a
high roof over it, as will be seen by the elevation. The
entrance, being at one side of the porch, gives more available
space for uninterrupted use during the warm weather. The hall
is 10 feet wide and 10&frac12; feet long. The stairway has first two
steps to a broad landing, and then a continuous movement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the second floor. If this landing were reduced in size by
making the approach more direct, say turning directly to the
left as one enters the door and going through a landing the
width of the stairway before making the general ascent, there
would be more available room in the hall. It is shown this way
in the drawing, because it is the way the house was built.
There is a closet in this hall. There are many houses built
without a closet on the first floor, but it is certainly better that
one be provided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_13" name="Plan_13"></a>
<img src="images/plan_13.png" width="500" height="387" alt="Plan No. 13" title="Plan No. 13" />
</div>

<p>As will be seen, there are three rooms on the first floor, and
four and a bath on the second. It is an easy house to care for,
because there is no waste space, and all the rooms are readily
accessible without extra steps. Waste room means waste of
energy and waste of money in more ways than one&mdash;waste not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
only as to the unnecessary expenditure in the cost of building,
but in carpets, and in the labor of sweeping and caring for
them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 416px;">
<a id="Fig_14" name="Fig_14"></a>
<img src="images/fig_14.png" width="416" height="500" alt="Fig. 14" title="Fig. 14" />
</div>

<p>In the parlor at the right of the hall are two windows and a
grate; one window is in front and the other at the side. The
dining-room is similarly equipped. It has a large china-closet
which connects with the table in the kitchen by means of a slide.
There is also a door between the kitchen and dining-room.
Eleven by twelve and a half feet is not large for a kitchen. The
availability of kitchen space is not entirely dependent, however,
on its dimensions, but rather upon the disposition of the wall-space
and the conveniences which have to do with a kitchen.
It will be seen that there is a space for the kitchen-range or
stove near the flue which does not conflict with the use of
any other part of the kitchen. Also there is a space between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the door which leads into the pantry and an outside wall which
gives place for a kitchen-safe, which may hold the kitchen
utensils. It is out of the way and yet convenient to the range.
The safe might be placed opposite the tables at the other end
of the kitchen, if thought desirable. The kitchen window is
placed about three feet above the floor. This gives wall-space
under it. Where a safe is not used, a cabinet, to contain pots,
kettles, etc., can be placed there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/plan_14.png" width="500" height="326" alt="Plan No. 14" title="Plan. No. 14" />
</div>

<p>The pantry is quite convenient to the kitchen. There is an
enclosed cupboard on one side which has doors and shelves
above and below, and in the recess next to the dining-room
wall is a place for open shelves. Near the pantry window is a
dough-board and a place for flour. Here, also, is the entrance
to the cellar. It will be seen that there is a door between the
pantry and hall, which makes it possible to pass from the kitchen
to the stairway or from the kitchen to the front hall without
going through other rooms. The enclosed cupboard in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
pantry makes it possible to keep it always tidy. There is a
glazed door in the rear of the kitchen.</p>

<img src="images/fig_15.png" width="352" height="500" alt="Fig. 15" title="Fig. 15" />
</div>

<p>It may be noticed that there is not a large hall to be carpeted
or swept on the second floor. This hall is well lighted by a
window at the side. From here one can go into any of the
rooms on the second floor. As to the bedrooms, there is a
convenient place for bedroom furniture in all of them. There
is at least a choice of two places for each bed, a space for
a dressing-case where it will get the best light, and room for a
wash-stand. There is a closet in each bedroom, of ample
capacity.</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_14">No. 14</a> is another edition of <a href="#Plan_15">Plan 15</a>. The room
lettered parlor is properly a sitting-room. By dispensing with
the grate in the reception-hall this house could be built, as it
was at one time, with a stairway meeting the one coming up
from the dining-room and passing from thence to the second
floor. The elevation of this house shows it with an attic,
though the plan does not contemplate this arrangement. Without
the attic and with a lower-pitched roof, this building,
without appurtenances, can be finished for $1,500.</p>

a bath-room, and a liberal supply of closets. One of the front
chambers is supplied with two, and the hall with two. There
is one in the bath-room, and each of the other rooms. The

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>OUTGROWTHS OF ONE IDEA.&mdash;EVERYTHING COUNTS AS A ROOM.&mdash;ONE
CHIMNEY.&mdash;CONVENIENCES OF A CONDENSED HOUSE.&mdash;COST
FROM $1,600 TO $2,800.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Plans <a href="#Plan_16">Nos. 16</a>, <a href="#Plan_17">17</a>, and <a href="#Plan_18">18</a> are all outgrowths of the same
idea. It is the most economical general scheme for a house
that is represented in this collection. In <a href="#Plan_16">No. 16</a> there is not
more than forty-eight square feet of hall space in the entire
house. This is on the second floor. This plan was devised
under an extraordinary pressure for a roomy house for a relatively
small sum of money. Everything is made to count for a room.
Twelve sets of plans of this general kind were made for as
many different owners of houses during one season. This
statement is made for the purpose of indicating its popularity.
We will look through <a href="#Plan_16">No. 16</a> with some respect to detail.</p>

<p>It is a one-chimney plan. There are three grates with independent
flues in the three principal rooms on the first floor, and
two grates with their flues on the second floor. One among
other points of economy is the stairway arrangement. It is a
combination, front, rear, and cellar all in compact form. There
are two doors between the kitchen and the landing of the main
stairway. In this respect it is like other combination stairways
which have been described. The front and rear stairway come
to the same landing, and from thence to the second floor. The
front stairway is provided with a railing, baluster, etc., and the
one from the kitchen is within an enclosure. There may be
portières between the landing and the reception-hall. Thus one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
may pass from the kitchen to the second floor without coming
into view from this room. The cellar stairway goes down under
the main stairway. The combination idea is carried out again
in the pantry and china-closet. This pantry and its arrangement
in detail are fully described in <a href="#Page_39">Chapter VI.</a>, and illustrated in
<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>. The vestibule next to the reception-hall is the one
referred to in <a href="#Page_31">Chapter V</a>.</p>

worked out, and, in some respects, it shows that the idea was
then in an experimental stage. However, it indicates a house of
moderate size on this plan, whereas No. 16 is a large house. No.
18 is the small size of the same plan. It has been built many
times as a rental house. With the furnace it is under lease, in
one instance, for five hundred dollars a year. In other cases,
without a furnace but including plumbing with the use of city
water only, the rent is thirty-five dollars a month. Any of these
plans can be worked into a double house by putting the bathroom
on the outside, and adding to the amount of window space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>ONE-STORY PLANS.&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF FLOOR PLANS.&mdash;BATH-ROOM
NEXT TO KITCHEN FLUE.&mdash;KITCHEN, PORCH, AND PANTRY.&mdash;THE
EXTERIOR.&mdash;ENLARGEMENTS ON THIS PLAN.&mdash;OTHER ONE-STORY
HOUSES.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>This house&mdash;Plan <a href="#Plan_19">No. 19</a>&mdash;has been built for $1,400. It
is a one-story cottage, containing five rooms, a bath-room,
and a pantry. Such a house is suited to young people of moderate
means, or possibly to older ones, where there are no children,
or where the housekeeper does her own work. It will be
seen that it gives more of the conveniences of a larger house
than are usually found in a cottage of this size.</p>

<p>From the porch we pass into a little vestibule, which might
be made larger by throwing into it the closet which opens from
the sitting-room. From the vestibule we go either into the
parlor or the sitting-room. This parlor could be used as the
living-room of the house, and the sitting-room as the dining-room,
and still meet all the conditions of good housekeeping.
Off from the sitting-room is a projection, which could be very
comfortably arranged as a window-seat. It could be used as
such during warm weather, and as a place for plants in
winter. In the corner of this room is a closet, which may be
connected with the kitchen by a slide. There are sliding doors
between the sitting-room and the bedroom. In the front part
of the bedroom is a large closet. It is possible that many would
prefer to have a window at this point, and have a smaller closet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
elsewhere; say, in the corner next to the sliding-door partition.
The placing of a closet next to the rear wall would leave no
place for a bed as the rooms are now arranged. If the door
from the parlor to the bedroom were omitted the head of the
bed might be placed against the sliding-door partition, and the
closet cut out from the rear bedroom, with an opening leading
into the front bedroom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_19" name="Plan_19"></a>
<img src="images/plan_19.png" width="500" height="431" alt="Plan No. 19 and Plan No. 20" title="Plan No. 19 and Plan No. 20" />
</div>

<p>From the sitting-room, or from the front bedroom, we pass
into a little hall; and from the hall into the kitchen, the bathroom,
or the rear bedroom. Over each of the five doors
leading into this hall there should be a transom; thus it would
be well lighted. The placing of the hall in this way makes all
of the rooms surrounding it independently accessible. The rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
bedroom has a place for a bed, a large closet, and a wall space
for necessary furniture. The availability of a bedroom is not
always dependent upon its size. A room may be large, and yet
not contain wall space for the furniture. A large bedroom may
have a small closet. This bedroom has a large one.</p>

<p>The bath-room comes next to the kitchen flue. This is
important when we consider that the kitchen flue is frequently
the last one in the house to get cool. As here arranged, the
pipe connections with the bath-tub would all be short; they
would all be near this flue, and on the inside wall. Hence the
conditions would be against freezing. There is a hollow
thimble in the pipe connections between the kitchen flue and
the bedroom. The bath-room might connect with the same flue
or flue-stack. Connecting with the bath-room there is a large
linen-closet, which is about the proper size and form for folded
bed-clothes. It is near the bath-room window, so that when
the closet-door is open the contents will be plainly in view.</p>

<p>There is a large window in one side of the kitchen, which
should be placed three feet from the floor, so as to admit of a
table being set under it. If the kitchen stove were placed
next the wall separating the kitchen and sitting-room, it could
be piped across to the kitchen flue, and in that way leave the
wall space adjacent to that flue and near the bath-tub for the
kitchen sink. This would bring all the plumbing work together.
At one side of this sink could be placed a well-pump, and a
cistern-pump at the other.</p>

<p>In the rear of the kitchen are a porch and a pantry. We go
down cellar directly from the kitchen. Over the headway of
the cellar stairs could be placed a closet for various stores, such
as canned fruit. This closet, of course, would be connected
with the pantry, as shown. The necessity for head room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
going into the cellar would make it necessary to place the floor
of this closet three or four feet above the pantry floor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<a id="Fig_20" name="Fig_20"></a>
<img src="images/fig_20.png" width="300" height="236" alt="Fig. 20" title="Fig. 20" />
</div>

<p>On the side of the pantry opposite this closet are two cup-boards, with
doors and shelves above and below. There is a place for a flour-bin or
flour-barrel under the dough-board, and space for an ice-box next to it.
This box should have a drain connecting with the outside. It is intended
to have the cellar under the kitchen and bath-room, though it might be
extended under the sitting-room also. This part of the cellar might be
used as a fuel-room, and thus dispense with wood and coal sheds. With
the fuel and water in the house, the housekeeper would be saved much
work. Where a kitchen sink is provided, it would be unnecessary even to
carry out the dish-water.</p>

<p>There are two flue-stacks in this building. A base-burner
would warm the sitting-room and bedroom and temper the air of
the parlor. A grate fire in the parlor would complete the work
of heating that room.</p>

<p>The cut of the exterior, <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>, tells its own story. The
porch has turned columns, and a frieze decorated with scroll-work.
The window seat may have a window at each end, as
shown in the floor-plan, or panels, as indicated in the elevation.
There is a gable at the side and over the window seat, which
extends the full width of the sitting-room.</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_19">No. 20</a> is a development of Plan <a href="#Plan_19">No. 19</a>. Without
appurtenances it cost $1,200.</p>

</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_21">No. 21</a> is an enlargement of <a href="#Plan_19">No. 19</a>. The pantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and china-room are arranged differently. The doors leading
into the china-room are glazed in their upper panels with
cathedral glass. This obscures the view, and gives sufficient
light. These doors were hung on double-spring hinges, so frequently
mentioned. Over the dining-room and chamber are
two finished bedrooms. They are arranged in the high part
of the roof, and, with dormers, would have only a small part of
the upper corners clipped. There are two grates more than
shown in Plan <a href="#Plan_19">No. 19</a>. The stairway arrangement may be
reversed, so that one goes to the second floor from the hall
rather than from the kitchen. This house cost, with two fin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>ished
rooms on the second floor, without appurtenances, as per
schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; $1,700.</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_21">No. 22</a> can be built and finished for $800. The gable
arrangement would be about the same as in Fig. <a href="#Fig_20">No. 20</a>.</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_23">No. 23</a> was built, including everything that went on
to the lot, for $1,600.</p>

<p>One-story houses cost more for the accommodations which
they afford than two-story buildings, for the reason that it takes
the same foundation and roof for a one-story house that it
does for one of two stories of the same area on the first floor.
In fact, it usually takes more foundation and roof for a one-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>story
house than it does for a two-story, for the reason that it
covers more ground space than would be required for the same
or a larger number of rooms in the two floors.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Plan_25">No. 26</a>. This is a peculiar type of a one-story house.
There is a servants room over the kitchen. It is a very comfortable
arrangement. The bath-room stands between the two
bedrooms. There is a grate in each of the rooms on the
lower floor. The kitchen-sink arrangements are not altogether
satisfactory. It is a plan which will never be very popular. It
is designed to be finished with shingles for the outside wall.
The structure will cost about two thousand dollars, as per
schedule &#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>SIDE-HALL PLANS.&mdash;PLANS WITH BEDROOM ON FIRST FLOOR.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_27">No. 27</a> is a side-hall plan with a bedroom on the first
floor. The parlor and sitting-room have views directly to
the front. The dining-room has a bay end, and a good china-passage
to the kitchen. There is a rear side-hall which is
desired by a good many people in building a large house. On
the second floor are four principal chambers, which are entirely
cut off from the rear bedroom, by bolting a door into the rear
hall. The bath-room is measurably detached from the rest of
the house, which fact will have the quality of satisfying people
who are suspicious of all plumbing. This building, without
appurtenances, according to schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; cost about three
thousand dollars.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_28">No. 28</a> has over two hundred dollars&#8217; worth of porch
attached to it. It is a side-hall plan, with the entrance to the
front. In it the combination stair idea is carried out in a way
previously mentioned, but not before illustrated. The rear
stairway is direct as to the servant&#8217;s room, and combined with
the central stairway only for entrance to the main part of the
house on the second floor. The arrangement of rooms on the
first floor makes this plan suitable for use by people who entertain
in a small way. This is the plan to which reference is
made in the special kitchen article, excepting that there is a
change in the position of the cellar stairway. There are two
closets and a wash-stand in the hall which connects the kitchen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a><br /><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>and sitting-room. This building, without appurtenances, as per
schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; cost between $2,800 and $2,900.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Plan_29" name="Plan_29"></a>

</div>

<p>In Plan <a href="#Plan_29">No. 29</a> the hall is in front, yet the entrance is at the
side. The stairway is at the rear end of the hall. A little door
is shown at the rear of the vestibule, leading under the stairway.
The closet is not very high, yet it is high enough to use as a
place to store a baby carriage or a small tricycle. The arrangement
of the entrance and the stairs admits of the use of the
hall as a room. In the house as constructed, there is a window
seat in the octagon end. There is a double railing coming down
into the hall. A part of the stairway is open on each side.
Opposite is a grate. There are also grates in the parlor and
sitting-room. By a little change in the kitchen arrangement, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
bedroom could be placed back of the sitting room, and the rear
and cellar stairway would occupy measurably the same position
as now. The kitchen would have to be a little narrower, and,
if desired, might be longer. The pantry and kitchen could both
be pushed a little to the left of where they now stand. In this
way space for a bedroom could be provided back of the sitting-room,
with possibly only a small projection to the right. The
rear vestibule could be cut out of the corner of the bedroom.
To prevent this from injuring the appearance of the room, a
corresponding space, to the left of this vestibule, could be
arranged into passage and closets for the bedroom and sitting-room.
In this event the rear bedroom wall would extend past
the rear kitchen wall. Attention is called to the size of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
closets on the second floor. By a slightly different arrangement
of the bath-room an additional bedroom could be provided.
There is a large attic over the front part of this house. The
entire side walls are covered with shingles dipped in stain.
There is a mild form of octagon tower over the front chamber.
The building, as here planned, cost $2,600, without the appurtenances
mentioned in schedule &#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Plan_30">No. 30</a>. Plans with bedrooms on the first floor are frequently
wanted. This requirement makes an ugly problem. It
increases the number of rooms on the first floor, and oftentimes
leaves a less number to be provided on the second story. In
this plan, including the bath and reception-hall, there are six
rooms on the first floor and three on the second, hence a good
deal of waste. There is a sink in the rear hall, second floor,
with water supply over it, to obviate the necessity of carrying
slops down stairs. Cost of building in brick, $3,000.</p>

<blockquote><p><small>MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTION.&mdash;SHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF ELEVEN
HOUSE PLANS.&mdash;VARYING COSTS.&mdash;SQUARE PLANS.&mdash;ONE-CHIMNEY
PLANS.&mdash;REAR AND SIDE HALL.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>A great many people like a side-hall entrance, as well as
one in front. Plan <a href="#Plan_32">No. 32</a> gives it. On the second floor
there are a large number of bedrooms. The rear stairway comes
up in a manner to separate the servant&#8217;s room from the front
part of the house. A double store-closet is shown on the rear
of the second floor. The front part of this closet may be left
unlocked and the other portion made secure. The bath-room in
the rear has direct connection with the water pipes as they come
up from the kitchen. All the bedrooms have the proper plan
for furniture. This house, without appurtenances, as per schedule
&#8220;B,&#8221; was built for about $4,000.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 488px;">

</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_33">No. 33</a> was used three times in one season, in slightly
differing forms, at a cost varying from $2,800 to $3,600, without
appurtenances, as per schedule &#8220;B.&#8221; In the matter of floor
space it is not an economical house. It makes a very pretty
arrangement of rooms on the first floor. There are five good
bedrooms and a bath-room on the second floor. The rear part
is measurably separated from the front by a door. A projecting
bay window from the family bedroom is shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_34">No. 34</a>. This is another plan that was made to order.
It is an economical arrangement, and, in many respects, very
convenient and satisfactory. The single stairway, passing from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the dining-room, will be the least satisfactory feature about the
whole house to the majority of people. However, the idea in
this connection is a good one. It is economical in that it dispenses
entirely with the hall. Furthermore, this stairway starts
from a room which will be used less than any on the first floor.
Few people will be inconvenienced by the use of the dining-room
as a hall. Part of this stairway goes into a hall leading
to the kitchen. The china-room and pantry arrangements in
this house are very satisfactory. On the second floor are five
bedrooms and a bath-room. The hall is lighted by a dormer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
over the stairway. This building, without appurtenances, would
cost about $2,500, as per schedule &#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_35">No. 35</a> is a house with a side entrance for small boys,
which is sometimes wanted. This plan meets such a requirement.
In the rear hall a coat closet is provided; also a rear
stairway. The vestibule in front of the reception-hall is sufficiently
large to admit of the placing of hat rack and other vestibule
furniture. The stairway is a pretty feature, though not
satisfactory to all. There is a closet in connection with the
music-room. In actual construction one was provided from
the kitchen. The second floor is self-explanatory. It was built,
as per schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; for $2,500.</p>

building are peculiar. A large number of bedrooms are required.
Other than bath and bedrooms, there are only the dining-room,
parlor, and kitchen. There is no cellar. There is a combination
stairway. One run starts from the front, and the other from the
rear. The landing is in the centre on the second floor. Cost
of this building, $2,000, as per schedule &#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>In <a href="#Plan_37">No. 37</a> the stairway is back of the reception-hall. It is
distinctively in the centre of the house, and is accessible from
all rooms. There is a passage through two doors from the
kitchen to the front part of the house. There is also the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a><br /><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>pantry passage. On the second floor there are four good bedrooms,
a linen closet, and a bath-room. The cost of the
building, without appurtenances, would be about $2,100, as per
schedule &#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_38">No. 38</a> is another square, one-chimney plan. The
house is broad enough so that it gives a little better bath-room
arrangement than is shown in some of the narrower plans. The
great drawback to this house is that there is only one stairway,
and that in front. If a cellar is wanted, the stairway can go
down under the main stairs.</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_39">No. 39</a>. This plan has six bedrooms on the second
floor. The hall on the first floor has two closets in front. There
is a projecting bay window from the first landing of the front
stairway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>This house was built for a minister. The library room is
shown. Projecting from it is a window-seat. On one side is a
large fireplace. The dining-room is separated from the front
part of the house by a hall. Both sitting-room and dining-room
have bay ends of a form to give a view to the street in front.
The side-hall communicates with the kitchen as well as the
dining-room. In this hall is a closet, presumably for the boys.
There is a liberal supply of closets on the second floor. The
servant&#8217;s room is cut off from the other part of the house. The
attic is plastered. This building, without appurtenances described
in schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; cost $3,500.</p>

thing which will commend this house, as far as its floor plan is
concerned. It is an old-style plan, and is wasteful of room.
The building cost about $3,100, as per schedule &#8220;B.&#8221;</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_41">No. 41</a> is an eight-room house with a simple stairway.
The outside walls are of brick. It has a side entrance. The
plan is a fairly good one. There are two closets on the first
floor, opening from the hall. There is an abundant supply on
the second floor. The building cost $3,400, as per schedule

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_42">No. 42</a> belongs to the centre hall type, which is less
common now than in years past. The parlor, as here lettered,

floor. In each of the four principal rooms a grate is indicated.
A hall communicating with the second floor from the cellar
is shown in the rear. The kitchen, pantry, and china-closet
arrangements are such as have been fully described in other
chapters. The side-porch, next to the pantry, affords means
of putting ice into the refrigerator without coming into the
room. The reception-hall and dining-room are connected by
sliding doors. Five bedrooms and a bath-room and liberal
closets are shown on the second floor. The front stairway
to this floor is broad and easy. The details of the exterior
of this structure were carefully rendered, and the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
altogether satisfactory. An outline drawing of the front is
shown. Small gables, similar in design to the one in front,
show from the sides. The building, according to schedule &#8220;B,&#8221;
cost $2,800, without the appurtenances.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>EIGHT PLANS.&mdash;EACH SUITED TO FAMILY REQUIREMENTS.&mdash;DOUBLE
HOUSES.&mdash;AN ELABORATE FLOOR PLAN.&mdash;A SHINGLE
HOUSE.&mdash;A BRICK HOUSE.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_43">No. 43</a>, while not economical as to arrangement, is
well suited to the requirements of the people who own it.
There are no children. The lady does not employ a servant.
The cost of the building would be about $2,200.</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_44">No. 44</a>. Double houses are not easy to plan where
they are very long. This house was built, one part to live in
and the other to rent. The living part has an entrance to the
front; and the rental part one, removed from it, at the side.
The centre partition is lined on both sides with sheathing lath;
that is, sheathing with dovetails cut into it, so that the plastering
will stick to it, which makes it solid, and, to a certain extent,
deadens the sound. The lettering of the plan clearly indicates
its arrangement. The cost, without appurtenances, as by schedule
&#8220;B,&#8221; is $5,000.</p>

<p>Most of the plans given that are only two rooms deep may
be made into double houses by enlarging the amount of window
space front and rear, and placing the bath-room side of the
house on the exposed side. This gives direct light.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Figure 24</span></span>
</div>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_45">No. 45</a>. This house is built on a plat of ground
having about seventy feet frontage. The side-hall arrangements
give two entirely independent rooms in front. There is a good
closet in the hall. From here we pass to the dining-room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>library, or parlor, and to the second floor. Only one stairway is
used. The pantry and china arrangements are shown. We
enter the cellar stairway from the pantry passage. The kitchen
is planned according to the general principles previously set
forth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/plan_43.png" width="500" height="408" alt="Plan No. 43" title="Plan No. 43" />
</div>

<p>On the second floor are four bedrooms and a bath-room.
Each room, including the bath, is supplied with closets, and
there is a linen closet in the hall. A stairway leads to the attic,
in which there is an abundance of room for other chambers,
should they be needed. The building, without appurtenances,
according to schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; cost $2,100. <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a> is a photographic
view of exterior.</p>

<p>Plan <a href="#Plan_46">No. 46</a> is not greatly different in its general arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a><br /><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ment
from others that have been shown. The details, however,
are more complete, and it is generally more satisfactory than other
houses of the same type. The vestibule arrangement in the
front hall is very satisfactory. There is a window-seat under the
stairs. The china-room arrangement is convenient. It has an
open stairway running out of it to the rear of the second story.
There is a laundry in the basement, and large closets on the
second floor.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p><a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a> is an elevation. It is a very picturesque house.
Cost, as by schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; $3,400.</p>

<p><a href="#Plan_47">Plan 47</a>. This house was designed for a west frontage. It
has a porch in front, a pagoda extension on the south side, and
a carriage-porch on the north side. There are a set of storm
doors and double inside doors. The reception-hall is thirteen
by fifteen feet in the clear. At one side of this hall is a grate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
There is an archway over the front window. On each side of
the mantel are shown seats, which may be treated as a part
thereof.</p>

<p>The stairway may be seen from this reception-hall. It is
separated from it merely by an open-work screen. The parlor
connects with the reception-hall by sliding doors. It has a large
window in front, and two smaller ones at the side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;">

<img src="images/fig_25.png" width="469" height="500" alt="Fig. 25" title="Fig. 25" />
</div>

<p>The parlor connects with the sitting-room by sliding doors,
as shown. There is a similar sliding door connecting the stair-hall
and sitting-room. Thus the reception-hall and stair-hall,
sitting-room and parlor, may be thrown together.</p>

<p>There is a bay end at the south side of the sitting-room.
Sliding doors are not indicated between the dining-room and
sitting-room, or between the dining-room and hall. They could
be so placed, if desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
There are two doors from the sitting-room to the dining-room,
one on each side of the fireplace. There is sufficient
wall space in the dining-room that these doors may be folded out
of the way. The library connects with the stair-hall and rear hall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<img src="images/plan_47.png" width="600" height="535" alt="Plan No. 47" title="Plan No. 47" />
</div>

<p>There is a large closet room under the stairway. In it is a
small closet, and places for a chest of drawers, and a wash-stand.
This would be particularly useful in case the library were to be
used as a bedroom.</p>

<p>There is a door separating the rear from the front hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
There are two doors between the kitchen and the rear hall. The
passageway between these doors is lighted by a window.</p>

<p>The sideboard in the dining-room is built into one end of
this room. The windows are placed about five feet above the
floor, and would look well of stained glass.</p>

<p>The kitchen is sixteen by sixteen feet. On one side are a
table, sink, drain, and table, successively arranged as here
named. In the china-closet is an extension of the last-named
table. There is a slide which cuts off communication between
the china-closet and the kitchen when this table is not in use.
In the china-closet are another sink, table, etc., which could be
used for washing and caring for the china, glass, and silver that
one does not care to take into the kitchen.</p>

<p>There is good ventilation in the kitchen. Back of the range
are shown two flues. A dry-box is placed on a level with the
top of the range, and has openings in the bottom and into the
flue. In this way, any articles placed therein will be readily
dried and ventilated. The warm air from the range passes
through the box and into the flue.</p>

<p>In the pantry are a dough-board and flour-bins, a cupboard
for stores, and one for utensils. There is space for an ice-box
or refrigerator next to the rear porch. It has a drain connection
with the outside.</p>

<p>The landing of the front stairway is in the front of the building,
as shown. The rear stairway is separated by a door from
the rear hall. In the bedrooms, the beds, dressing-cases, and
wash-stands are indicated on the plan. The front chamber has
a circular window in front. Each room can be entered from the
hall without going through any other room. There is a grate
in each chamber. The closets are all very large; in each of the
front rooms they are three and one-half by four and one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
feet. In the south-side chambers one is three and one-half by
four feet, and the other is four by four feet. In the rear hall
there is a large closet which may be used for general purposes.
In all closets on this floor there is abundant room for drawers,
hooks, shelves, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>The bath-room arrangement is somewhat different from that
in general use. It will be noticed that the water-closet is separated
from the bath-room proper, though connected with it by
a door. One can enter either the bath-room or this water-closet
room from the rear hall. In the bath-room is a large
closet in which may be arranged a chest of drawers, and, if
desired, a ventilated receptacle for soiled linen. This closet is
lighted by a window. Cost, as by schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; $10,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Plan No. 48 is of a house well suited to the requirements of

<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>Plan <a href="#Plan_50">No. 50</a>. This is a plan of a brick house, built, without
appurtenances, as per schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; for $10,000. The
external walls are of selected dark cherry red brick, laid in red
mortar. The stone work, where exposed above grade, is of
Ohio red sandstone, quarry face. There is very little detail to
the exterior. The general style of design is quiet and unobtrusive.
Red sandstone is selected to go with the brick-work
in order to present a solid mass of color, rather than a variation
between a light stone and brick work. The interior is
complete in all its details; the attic is finished as well as the
parlor; all is of quartered oak. Over the butler&#8217;s pantry, in the
rear of the hall, is a balcony. Above this balcony is a
large window, twelve feet wide and ten feet high, divided with
narrow mullions, and glazed with artistic patterns of stained
glass. At one side of the hall is a large fireplace, with
panelled wood-work above to ceiling. The sides of the hall
are wainscoted to the height of six feet with small panels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
The ceiling is of oak. The dining-room and library are finished
the same as hall, with oak ceiling omitted. Other details of
the plan, in the light of what has been said in previous chapters,
are self-explanatory. All has been planned according
to the general principles set forth. The butler&#8217;s pantry is
arranged so that all china and glassware are cared for in that
room rather than in the kitchen. <a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a> is an exterior view of

<h2>PRACTICAL HOUSE-BUILDING.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>PRACTICAL POINTS.&mdash;WATER.&mdash;LOCATION OF HOUSE ON LOT.&mdash;DRAINING
THE CELLAR.&mdash;MASON WORK.&mdash;FOUNDATIONS.&mdash;WALKS.&mdash;PIERS.&mdash;FLUES.&mdash;CISTERNS.&mdash;DAMP
COURSE.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>In this section of the book it is proposed to consider, in as
plain a manner as possible, the construction of all the details
of a house.</p>

<h4>LOCATING THE HOUSE.</h4>

<p>First is the placing of the house on the lot. If it have an
east or a west front, it is common to set the north side of the
house within a few feet of the north line. On a small lot this
gives more south and sun exposure. The distance the house is
set back from the front of the lot depends largely upon what
one&#8217;s neighbors have done or may do. In the case of a north
or south frontage, the west side of the house is usually placed
to the west line. This brings the east side of the house in the
afternoon shade. Under any circumstances, there should never
be less than eighteen inches of space beyond the north or west
wall. If the projection of cornice is greater, there should be
more than this.</p>

<h4>WATER.</h4>

<p>The next thing to do when one begins to build, is to
provide water for the builder. This is from the city water
service, if any; otherwise from a well. If a driven well is
used, it is best to locate it on the inside of the house, near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the kitchen sink, and allow the builder to provide a common
pump for use during building operations. The cistern and well
pumps should go into the plumber&#8217;s contract. It is not necessary
that all the plumbing contract be let at the time the city
water service is supplied. The method of letting contracts is
explained in another part of the book.</p>

<h4>EXCAVATING.</h4>

<p>In excavating for a house, the loam, or upper strata of earth,
should be separated from that which comes below. After the
walls are placed, the openings around the outside should not
be filled at once; certainly not until the wall is dry and the
mortar set. After this, the grading and filling should begin.
The grade line of the house should be slightly above that of
the sidewalk, and there should be a general slope to it. If there
is an alley in the rear, the slope should be divided to reach it,
if possible. The drainage, excavating and filling connected
with the plumbing, gas supplies, etc., should be done early in
the building period. Thus the entire surface becomes compact
and natural by the time the building is finished. If it should
become apparent that there will be superfluous earth, it should
be removed from the lot.</p>

<h4>DRAINING.</h4>

<p>Where there is a clay soil, and in sections of the country
where cellars are inclined to be damp, they should be drained.
This is done in various ways; usually by running an open farm
tile around and below the level of the cellar wall, which should
have connection preferably with a dry well; but if nothing better
presents itself, with the sewer drain, although a connection of
this kind is not safe. The air which will come into this drain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
from the sewer will contaminate the soil, and in that way affect
the health of the occupants of the building. In some instances
a sewer connection from this drain is necessary, but only then
should it be used.</p>

<p>Another method of draining a cellar is to excavate below
the level of lowest mason-work, and fill in a depth of about
twelve inches with broken stone, which is given a drain connection
with proper outlet. The space between stone particles acts
as a drain.</p>

<h4>MASON-WORK.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 208px;">
<a id="Fig_30" name="Fig_30"></a>
<img src="images/fig_30.png" width="208" height="250" alt="Fig. 30" title="Fig. 30" />

<p>The mason-work should be of brick or stone. First, we will
consider that of brick, which is common to frame houses and
is sometimes used for brick buildings. The foundations,
walks, piers, and flues should be of hard burned brick. All
should be laid wet, excepting in freezing
weather, with lime mortar. The outside exposed
brick should be preferably of a dark
cherry-red color, laid in white or red mortar.
The latter is in most general use. The joints
for exposed work should be in form as indicated
in Fig. 30; in mason&#8217;s parlance, these are
called &#8220;rodded joints.&#8221; The joint is first cut down from above,
with trowel, then the rod is placed along the upper edge of the
joint, and the mortar is cut away with a knife in the form indicated.
Then the vertical joints are trimmed in the same way;
thus no mortar projects beyond the face of the brick. This
form of joint is desirable for all kinds of exposed work,
where one desires better work than is usual in foundations and
other exposed brick work. Brick work should have struck or
common joints in the cellar and outside exposed walls, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
where small cost is of great importance. Brick work should be
left rough where it is desired to plaster. Foundation walls and
piers usually continue from sixteen to thirty inches above
grade; twenty or twenty-four inches is most common. On this
is placed a sill in most frame houses. Outside walls and piers
generally begin from eighteen to thirty inches below grade line,
where not influenced by the cellar. In an ordinarily cold climate
the freezing line is four or five feet. Eighteen inches or two
feet is usual, however, in the construction of frame buildings,
and the results are not unsatisfactory. A damp-course of slate
or hard limestone is sometimes placed just above the grade line,
to prevent the passage of moisture from the brick wall below to
that above. These general statements as to brick work apply
alike to that used in brick and frame buildings, as do also the
statements as to interior walls, chimneys, etc., which follow.</p>

<p>To prevent the passage of moisture through brick walls below
grade from the outside, a coating of Portland cement is sometimes
used. Coal-tar is also used, but is not as good as the
cement.</p>

BRICKS.&mdash;BRICK VENEERING.&mdash;HOT-AIR FLUES.&mdash;DETAILS
OF BRICK CONSTRUCTION.&mdash;CHIMNEYS AND FLUES.&mdash;HOLLOW
WALLS.&mdash;CELLAR.&mdash;ASH-PITS.&mdash;GRATES.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>A brick wall under a frame house is ordinarily nine inches
thick; that is, it is called a nine-inch wall. In reality, it
is the thickness of the length of a brick. Under these walls are
placed footings. For a two-story frame house there are usually
two footings of two courses each projecting two inches. Thus
a nine-inch wall would have the bottom footing seventeen inches
wide. In ordinary American brick work there is what is called
a bond to each seventh course. The bond is made by laying
the brick crosswise the wall rather than lengthwise. In that way
it ties or bonds the wall together in the direction of its length.
Below grade, where the brick work is not exposed, the bond is
made by laying a continuous course of brick in this way. Above
the grade, the bond is made by laying each alternate brick across
the wall. This is called a header and stretcher bond. The
stretcher is the brick which lies lengthwise the wall in the common
way, and the header is the one which shows its head and
runs crosswise the wall to form the bond. Thus there is a continuous
row of alternating headers and stretchers in the bond
course, which occurs, as said before, each seventh course.
Another bond, by some brick-layers called the American bond,
does not show on the outside. The corners of the inside of the
outer row of bricks are clipped, so that the bond brick runs part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
way into the outside course, and thus is out of sight. It is an
artificial arrangement and not satisfactory; it is not good construction.
The header and stretcher bond is the best for
exposed work, where both appearance and solidity are to be
considered. There are other forms of bond,&mdash;the old English
and the Flemish,&mdash;but they need not be considered here.</p>

<p>All brick should be thoroughly &#8220;slushed&#8221; with mortar;
that is, all spaces between brick should be thoroughly filled.
The ideal condition would be to have all brick excepting the
exposed faces entirely surrounded by mortar.</p>

<p>The selection of the brick for the exposed fronts in a frame
as well as a brick house should be made before the brick work
is begun; at least a large supply should be selected and piled
up. While the brick cannot all be of the same shade, different
shades can be selected for different walls&mdash;a lighter shade for
a north wall, and a darker for a south wall, a different shade for
an east and a west wall. Very slight variations can be made in
the ells and projections. This would apply to pressed, stock,
or common brick, though pressed brick is usually selected before
delivery.</p>

<p>The best color for exposed work is a dark cherry red. The
best-appearing work with indifferent brick can be made with
the use of a reddish brown mortar. The use of this kind of
mortar is increasing. White putty mortar is made in the ordinary
way, excepting that white sand, similar to that from Lake
Pontchartrain, rather than gray sand, is used. It contains more
lime than ordinary mortar. The mortar is said to be richer.</p>

<p>Black brick are made by heating and then dipping in coal-tar.
Enamelled, glazed, and colored brick can be purchased in
the larger markets as desired. Various forms of ornamental
brick work are possible even where only the common brick are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
used. Moulded pressed brick are quite common, and the
results of their use very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Brick veneering is not unusual in sections of the country
where brick is very expensive and the effect of a brick house
desired. It is a four-inch brick wall anchored to a frame structure.
The anchoring is sometimes accomplished by driving
twenty-penny nails into wood-work in a way to project into
joints.</p>

<p>Hot-air flues in brick walls are sometimes tin-lined, though
this is not necessary when they are smoothly plastered, providing
it is possible to make them eight inches square. If they cannot
be made deeper than the width of a brick, four inches, they
should be tin-lined. A four-inch hot-air flue can be placed in a
nine-inch wall by setting the two outside rows of brick on edge.</p>

<p>Hollow walls have not been regarded with great favor during
recent years, for the reason that it is difficult to secure their
proper construction. A hollow wall is usually twelve inches
in thickness, with the middle course of brick omitted excepting
at the corners and adjacent to openings. Suitable ties are
placed across the open space.</p>

<h4>CELLAR.</h4>

<p>It now is in order to consider various features of interior
brick work and details which come in connection therewith.
Cellars are usually from seven to eight feet deep. As this does
not give all the height necessary for furnace or other heating
apparatus, it is usually pitted; that is, it is let down into the
cellar floor, and a brick area built around the opening to the
furnace-door. Because of the necessity for pitting the furnace,
the walls of the house adjacent thereto should continue eighteen
inches below the level of other walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Walls inside of cellar should continue to the top of joist.
This completely separates the different compartments of the
cellar, or from that part of the house where there is no cellar.</p>

<p>There should be a man-hole opening to the parts under the
house where there is no cellar.</p>

<p>Lintels or wooden supports should be provided over all
openings in cellar, and over all openings in inside brick walls.</p>

<p>Wooden brick should be provided and built in where it is
necessary to attach wood work to brick work. Usually this is
about two feet six inches apart in a vertical or horizontal direction.
The wooden brick should be the thickness of the brick
itself and the mortar joints; that is, there should be no mortar
above or below a wooden brick. Iron ventilators should be
provided; one in each outside wall under each room where cellar
windows are not provided. Windows are not usually provided
where there is no cellar.</p>

<h4>CHIMNEYS.</h4>

<p>It is known that wood-work should not come directly in contact
with chimneys. The framework should never rest on a
chimney. There are reasons for this other than those which
have a regard for safety from fire, one of which is that the chimney
is not liable to settle. If it does not, the shrinkage of the
wood-work, which in a two-story frame house will sometimes
amount to two inches in the height of the building, makes a
high place around the flues, where the frame comes in contact
with or rests on the chimney. All chimney-stacks should extend
above highest point of ridge of roof, and the extreme tops should
be laid in Portland cement. All the exposed brick of the chimney
should be hard-burned. If due regard were paid to these
points, there would be no rickety chimney-tops. All flues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
should be thoroughly plastered on the inside. If chimneys
were plastered on the outside, wherever they come in contact
with the wood-work, the complaint of fires from defective flues
would be hushed.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a> illustrates the common form of constructing a chimney
breast where a grate is to be used. The flues are eight
and one-half inches square. A passage
to the ash-pit is shown. The grate opening
is two feet wide; the jambs on each
side are one foot six inches wide; thus the
entire width of the breast is five feet.
Other dimensions as indicated. Where
there are grates on two floors of the house,
one above the other, or where it is desirable
for any reason to have a flue pass around a
grate, it is necessary that the breast should
be five feet wide. It is clear that the grate
from below must have its own flue out to
the top of the chimney. Thus the grate flue from the first
story must pass around the grate of the second story, if there be
one. If there is no grate above, or if it is not desired to pass
a flue around the first-story grate, the chimney breast need be
only four feet wide; that is, it would have the usual two-feet
opening to the grate, and twelve rather than eighteen inch jambs
on each side. On one side of the dotted line is indicated flue
construction for a brick wall, and on the other for a wood wall.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 224px;">

<img src="images/fig_31.png" width="224" height="350" alt="Fig. 31" title="Fig. 31" />
</div>

<p>The hearth should rest on what is called a trimmer arch,
which is made of brick. It springs from the chimney breast to
the header of wood in front. It is four inches in thickness. It
is laid in the ordinary way, and at the proper time is filled on the
top with concrete by the mantel-setter. In case a grate on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
second floor connects with the ash-pit, one of the flues at
the side is used for this purpose.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 278px;">
<a id="Fig_32" name="Fig_32"></a>
<img src="images/fig_32.png" width="278" height="350" alt="Fig. 32" title="Fig. 32" />
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a> indicates a common form of corner grate. The flues
in this as well as <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a> are drawn close together and come out
through the attic and roof in a smaller
stem. There should be distinct separation
of flues.</p>

<p>Ash-pits are frequently made of four-inch
brick walls strengthened by brick
pilasters. These pits are usually from
three to four feet in depth and the width
of the chimney breast, and nearly as high
as the depth of the cellar. Where more
than one grate empties into an ash-pit, it
is common to divide it into compartments, one for each fire.
The top of the pit is crowned with a brick arch. Ash-dumps
are sometimes provided for the grate, depending, of course, upon
the kind of grate used, and ash-pit doors of iron for the pits
themselves.</p>

<h4>OUTSIDE CELLAR-WAY.</h4>

<p>The side walls of an outside cellar-way should continue to
the bottom of cellar. It should be floored the same as the
cellar itself.</p>

<h4>AREAS.</h4>

<p>Areas of brick should be provided around all cellar openings
that continue below grade. The bottoms of these areas should
be floored with paving-brick. This is better than cement, as it
admits of natural drainage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>STONE MASONRY.&mdash;CUT STONE.&mdash;TERRA COTTA.&mdash;PRIVY VAULTS.&mdash;CISTERNS.&mdash;FILTERS
FOR CISTERNS.&mdash;BRICK PAVEMENTS.&mdash;CEMENT PAVEMENTS.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Stone foundations for dwelling-houses are usually made of
native stone, and anything that may be said here must necessarily
conform to general rather than special conditions. The
best stone that can be used for this purpose is hard, non-absorbent
limestone. There are many varieties of stone conglomerates
throughout the country which are valuable for foundation uses.
Stone should be laid up in lime mortar in the direction of its
natural bed in the quarry, with a sufficiency of bond stone.
For ordinary dwelling-house work there should be at least one
footing eight inches in depth, and six inches projection on each
side of the wall. Stone walls for foundations are usually made
not less than eighteen inches in thickness. It is not easy to lay
a good stone wall less than eighteen inches in thickness. While
the same number of cubic feet of stone work may cost less than
brick work, a stone foundation ordinarily would cost more than
one of brick for the reason that a brick wall does not have to be
so thick. It usually takes about half the number of cubic feet
of brick work that it does of stone work to answer the same
purpose. Where stone is available at low cost it is best to use
it. Interior brick walls may rest on stone footings. The inside
of stone walls should be neatly pointed after other work has
been finished. Stone work above grade may be finished in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
many ways&mdash;random range work, rubble work, regular course
range work, etc. After the other work has been finished, the
mortar should be raked out a short distance and a finish joint
added.</p>

<h4>CUT STONE.</h4>

<p>Cut-stone work is too large a subject to consider in detail.
There are several points which cannot be overlooked. There
should be drips cut under all projections, so that the water will
not run down the other stone or brick work and stain it. A
drip is merely a little V-shaped channel cut on the under side
of the stone work. They are found on the under side of
most window-sills. In door, window, or other openings, the
stone work should underlie or overlie all wood work at least two
inches. This may be explained by stating that the stone window-sill
should underlie the wood sill two inches, and the
window cap should overlie the wood cap at least two inches.
Generally speaking, coping should project on each side of the
wall about two inches. Sills should extend at least one inch
beyond the face of the wall. Window-sills should be no less
than five inches in thickness. Door-sills should generally be
about seven or eight inches, and extend at least one inch beyond
the face of the wall, and through its full thickness. The water
table of the stone foundation usually forms the window cap of
the cellar windows, and the cap course, which comes at the
grade line, the cellar window-sills. In this case it is necessary
that the stone should run farther into the wall where the openings
occur.</p>

<p>Stone steps are not over six and one-half to seven and one-half
inches in thickness, with from nine to twelve inch treads.
They underlie and lap about one inch, and have walls, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
material as the foundation, for lower supports. These walls
should go to the full depth of the house walls with which they
come in contact. Thus there is no danger of settling. Stone
steps are frequently used in the front of the yard from the side-walk
to the grade level where there is considerable elevation.
In such cases it is necessary to use stone side pieces for the
steps, to prevent caving and to make a neat finish. Where
flagging is cheap, it is well to use it for walks and porch floors.</p>

<h4>TERRA-COTTA WORK.</h4>

<p>Terra cotta is the perfection of brick-making. It is the only
building material which is not affected by changes of temperature,
or other natural or artificial conditions to which the building
may be subject. It may be described as being a very plastic
material; that is, anything can be done with it. It can be
worked into any form that is desired, excepting long lintels, and
even in that case there are means of arriving at the desired
result and giving a lintel form in a very proper manner. Ornamental
terra cotta is modelled by artists before being burned,
and the best results may naturally be expected.</p>

<h4>PRIVY VAULT.</h4>

<p>The size of the privy vault is usually three and one-half by
four and one-half feet, elliptical, and from ten to twenty feet
deep, according to the character of the soil. Usually it is walled
up with four-inch dry brick wall. Piers should be provided at
corners for privy building. In some instances it is required that
the privy vault should be made water-tight. In that case it
should be built the same as a cistern, with round bottom and
cemented interior surface. When it is desired to connect the
privy vault with the sewer, it should be cemented in the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
just described, with a siphon vitrified pipe connection with the
drain to the sewer. The siphon prevents solid rubbish, which
may be thrown into the vault, from getting into the drain and
clogging it.</p>

<h4>CISTERN.</h4>

<p>The cistern is generally located near the rear kitchen wall,
say ten or twelve feet therefrom. The walls, arch, and neck are
usually four inches in thickness when capacity of cistern does
not exceed one hundred and twenty-five barrels. Otherwise the
brick work mentioned should be eight inches in thickness. The
brick should be laid in domestic cement, and smoothly coated
with Portland cement. It should be connected with the down
spouts of the house by means of vitrified drain-pipe, the same
as described in connection with plumbing work, though it has
no connection therewith.</p>

<p>The following table gives capacity of cisterns of various sizes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<h4>FILTERS.</h4>

<p>There are various ways of forming a filter. One is to have
a small cistern of eight or ten barrel capacity, located between
the main cistern and house. It should be divided by a brick
wall laid in mortar, but not cemented on either side. The water
enters on one side, passes through the brick wall in the middle,
and from thence to the cistern beyond. Another plan is to
cement the wall, leave an opening at the bottom, and pack the
side on which the water enters with charcoal, sand, and gravel.
The water passes through this packing and the opening below
to the other side of the filter, and then to the cistern. Still
another plan is to build the partition as first described on the
inside of the cistern proper. All of the water passes to one
side of the divided cistern, and through the partition before
being drawn out. Thus it has to pass through the brick before
it is to be drawn out. Still another filter is made by building
what is called a beehive in the bottom of the cistern. It is a
beehive form of brick work, with the pump pipe leading to the
inside, so that all water has to be drawn through the brick beehive
before it is pumped out. According to this plan, as well as
the others mentioned, the water is strained through the brick.</p>

<p>It is best that the cistern and independent filter, when used,
should be provided with iron rims and cast-iron covers. It is
good practice to connect the cistern with a dry well, which is
constructed the same as an open vault excepting that the top is
arched. This dry-well connection is by means of five-inch
vitrified pipe laid in the same manner as sewer pipe.</p>

<p>There is a practice, altogether too common among builders,
of connecting the cistern overflow with the vault or sewer.
Nothing could be worse than this. The water is certain to be
polluted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<h4>BRICK PAVEMENT.</h4>

<p>Brick pavements are used for walks around the house, and
sometimes for cellar floors. Cement floors, however, are better
for cellars. Brick pavement of all kinds should be made of hard-burned
bricks, laid on a six or eight inch bed of sand. The
brick walk should not be laid until after all the grading and filling
of the lot has been done. It is best to leave the brick walks
out of the general contract, so that this work can be delayed
until after the house is finished. It is a good thing to have the
sodding and the paving in the same contract. The contractor
who attends to the sodding can work the two together to a
better advantage than if the walks were placed and the sodding
done afterwards.</p>

<h4>CEMENT PAVEMENT.</h4>

<p>Cement pavements are used for walks around the house, and
for cellar floors. Cement is more expensive than brick. The
surface to be covered should, first, be levelled, then saturated
with water; after which is laid a three-inch bed of cement concrete,
made of gravel, sand, and cement in proper proportions.
Upon this is placed a three-fourth-inch layer of cement mortar.
Ordinary American, hydraulic cement may be used for concrete,
but for the three-fourth-inch layer nothing but best Portland
cement should be considered. Sometimes the cement work in
the cellar is done by the plasterer. Outside cement work for
walks requires special skill. In most large cities there are those
who make a business of doing this work. They have different
formulas and methods of reaching the proper results.</p>

<h4>CARPENTER WORK.</h4>

<p>In considering carpenter work, we will first take up framing,
and everything which pertains to the outside of the house.
All material used for framing should be sound, square-edged
material, free from imperfections tending to impair its use, durability,
or strength. In different parts of the country, different
kinds of lumber are standard for framing purposes. In the
South and sections contiguous to it, yellow pine is used; in the
North, white pine, hemlock, Norway spruce, poplar, and even
hard wood. It is neither profitable nor desirable in this connection
to indicate any particular material; it is natural to use the
cheapest that is sufficiently strong for framing. The following
table indicates the sizes of timber in common use in framing an
ordinary dwelling.</p>

</table></div>

<p>Sizes here given may not be adapted to all sections. There
is no occasion for being arbitrary. The sizes may be conformed
to the material which is ordinarily used.</p>

<p>Stories ten and a half feet high are generally considered the
limit in an ordinary frame house at this time. Nine and a half
and ten are more common. This is quite different from the
general tendency to high stories a few years ago. Certainly,
it is more rational.</p>

<h4>JOISTS.</h4>

<p>Joists are usually dressed, so that they have about one-half-inch
crown or curve on their upper surface, which would
make the centre of the room about one-half inch higher
than the sides. They should be trimmed so that all are of
the same width and form. Double trimmers and headers&mdash;that
is, double joist&mdash;should be framed around all chimney-breasts,
well-holes, scuttles, and openings in the wall. In
dwelling-house work they should be mortised and tenoned
together, as should be the pieces connecting therewith. In very
cheap work headers and trimmers are sometimes spiked together.
This is not good practice. For very good work, where heavy
weights are to be carried, trimmers and headers should be supported
on wrought-iron strips. This, however, is not necessary
in ordinary dwelling-house work.</p>

<p>Joists longer than eighteen feet should be twelve inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
width. Those running adjacent or parallel to partition or other
walls should be firmly spiked thereto. Double joists should be
placed under all partitions and supports having no support
from below. Where the weight is extra heavy, the double joists
should be trussed by a two-by-four-inch stud, spiked in truss
form, between them. There should be one row of truss bridging
to each span or tier, size as indicated. Header should be
framed across pipe duct, about eighteen inches therefrom.</p>

<h4>STUD WALLS.</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 145px;">
<a id="Fig_33" name="Fig_33"></a>
<img src="images/fig_33.png" width="145" height="400" alt="Fig. 33" title="Fig. 33" />
</div>

<p>See <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>. Walls and partitions are usually of two-by-four-inch
studding. In large houses it is best that the studding
be two by six inches, and plates four inches in
thickness and the width of the studding are
commonly placed at the bottom and top of the
walls of each story. Sometimes, however, the
studding continues to the height of two stories,
and the joists are supported on a one-by-six-inch
&#8220;ribbon&#8221; piece let into the studding.</p>

<p>Trusses or supports should be framed
over all openings. Sliding-door pockets or
runways should be lined with flooring. All
corners and angles should be framed solid
and have two-inch projections for lathing.
Studding four by four inches thick should be
framed around all window openings and on
three sides of the door openings; bridging,
two by two inches, one row for each story. Grounds should be
placed on the inside openings, and elsewhere for plastering.
The pipe duct, fourteen inches wide, should be placed between
studding from kitchen to attic floor. All outside walls of frame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
houses should be diagonally sheathed with seven-eighths-by-six-inch
dressed sheathing. Tongued and grooved material is best
for this purpose, although it is not in common use. All sheathing
should be covered with six-pound sized building-paper.</p>

<p>Sometimes the insides of brick walls are furred. This means
that they are lined on the inside with wood strips two inches in
thickness, sixteen inches on centres, and then lathed and plastered.
This prevents the passage of the moisture through the
brick into the inside of the room.</p>

<p>Various forms of sheathing lath for inside sheathing of a
frame house are now in use. This form of lath contemplates
a seven-eighth-inch tongued and grooved sheathing on the
inside with dove-tailed channels cut into its surface, which form
key-room for the plastering.</p>

<h4>ROOF.</h4>

<p>Most roofs can be formed with out-posts and purlins. All
can be formed in this way where cost is not considered. An
ordinary dwelling-house of the size given in these plans does
not require separate posts and purlins. There should be double
rafters around all chimneys and openings in the roof.</p>

<p>The roof should be sheathed with seven-eighths by four-inch
material; where exposed to view, with five-and-one-half-inch
beaded flooring. Where deck framing is required, posts and
purlins are necessary, size according to weight to be carried.</p>

<p>Where shingles are used for roofing, they should be laid
four and one-half inches to the weather for sixteen-inch shingles,
with two nails to each. It is best that shingles should be
dipped in stain, oil, or paint before they are put on the roof.
The durability of shingles is not increased by being painted after
they have been laid. The ridge finish of the shingle or slate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
roof should be of galvanized iron, with about four-inch lap on
each side. It may be made as ornamental as desired. Wood
should never be used for this purpose. Hips and ridges of slate
or shingle roofs may be finished with tin or galvanized iron,
lapped on each side about three and one-half inches. Gutters
of galvanized iron set up on the first course of shingles or slate,
with metallic support from above or below, are better than
gutters of wood tin-lined.</p>

<p>Where slate covering is used, any size slate desired may be employed,
bearing in mind that the bond should not be less than three and one-half
or four inches. There should be two nails to each slate.</p>

<h4>OUTSIDE FINISH.</h4>

<p>All lumber used for outside finish should be thoroughly seasoned, clear,
smoothly dressed, and free from imperfections tending to impair its use,
durability, strength, or appearance. Poplar is the ideal building
material for outside finish. It takes paint better than other woods used
for this purpose. However, pine is generally used, for the reason that
it is cheaper. Weather-boarding is usually laid with an inch lap four
and one-half inches to the weather; three and one-half inches is better.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<a id="Fig_34" name="Fig_34"></a>
<img src="images/fig_34.png" width="350" height="107" alt="Fig. 34" title="Fig. 34" />
</div>

<p>Drop siding, or German siding as it is sometimes called, makes a warmer
and better wall than weather-boarding. It is usually six or eight inches
wide, and in form and construction as indicated by <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>.</p>

<p>Outside shingle walls are now quite common. Shingles are
used for ornamental purposes in a large proportion of the
houses that are built; in some instances they are used exclu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>sively
for outside covering. In such cases they are undressed,
and are stained commonly with one of the proprietary stains
now on the market. Before being placed they are dipped into
the stain for about eight inches from their buts, and are laid in
piles to dry. Any desired color may be secured, and there are
instances where stained shingled walls have gone without any
attention or expense for eight or ten years.</p>

<p>Dressed shingles are commonly painted. Their form may
be as ornamental as desired. Outside shingles are sometimes
laid five and one-half inches to the weather, but four and one-half
is better. It is not uncommon at this time to leave all
shingles unpainted and unstained. The effect is very agreeable
when they become weather-stained.</p>

<h4>OUTSIDE CASINGS.</h4>

<p>All horizontal trimmings and casings should be bevelled on
the top to shed the water. They should run back under the
shingled weather-boarding or other outside covering. There
should be tin covering for all projections in excess of one and
three-eighths inch. Ordinary window or door casings outside
are usually three-eighths inch thick.</p>

<h4>WINDOWS.</h4>

<p>All windows in the part of the house regularly occupied
should have box frames. Pulley styles should be of hard wood,
and the inside bead should be secured with round-headed screws.
Sash for plate glass should be one and three-fourths inch
thick; side rail, two and one-half inches in rabbet; bottom rail,
three and one-eighth inches; and meeting rail, one and one-fourth
inch in the rabbet. Sash for common glass may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
one and three-eighths inch thick. Other sizes, as given. Sash,
for rooms finished in hard wood is better when of the wood in
which the room is finished. However, where there is great
variation this is not necessary. Quartered oak is the material
commonly used for hard-wood sash. Almost any hard wood
is more liable to warp than pine. All box frames should be
provided with turned axle pulleys. Nothing but the best plaited
cotton sash-cord should be used. Necessary weights should be
provided.</p>

<p>In some of the plans where wide front windows are indicated,
the design is called pocket head. There is a pocket above the
head of the frame so that a high sash may be run into it. The
sash may be pushed up into the pocket; that is, it runs into
the wall above the head of the frame. Where the pocket-head
window is used, it is necessary that there be a clear space above
the frame for the sash to be run up equal to the height of the
sash itself.</p>

<p>Hinged or pivoted windows have rabbeted frames which are
usually one and three-eighths inch thick. They are used for
the most part in unfinished cellars, attics, and unoccupied parts
of the house, and preferably for pantry, store-room, and, occasionally,
bath-room windows. They may be hung on hinges or
pivots. Hinges are better, for the reason that fly screens cannot
be used where the sash is pivoted. Sills should slant twenty
degrees, with drip piece secured to outside. This prevents the
storm from blowing water to the inside.</p>

<h4>OUTSIDE SHUTTERS.</h4>

<p>Outside shutters are usually one and three-eighths inch
thick, with movable slats; if more than six and one-half feet
high, they should be made in three panels each. Arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
are provided by various manufacturers of hardware for opening
outside shutters from the inside of the room. They may be
swung either from the sides or top at will. When they are suspended
from above they act as an awning; they admit the air
but not the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Sometimes shutters are cut at the meeting rail, so that the
upper or lower section may be opened as desired.</p>

<h4>PORCHES.</h4>

<p>At this time it is not usual to provide special ceiling for porches. The
rafters and all exposed material are dressed so that they may be painted
or stained. Floor joists are not usually more than two by eight inches;
sills, about six by eight. The floor should be inclined about one-eighth
of an inch to the foot, and made of hard wood, tongued and grooved, not
over two and three-fourths inches in width. Edges should be finished
with nosings, which are rounded edges. The roof of the porch is usually
the same as that of the body of the house. Gutters are similar to those
on other roofs.</p>

<p>Railing and turned balusters are usual, excepting where an opening for
passage is desired.</p>

<h4>LATTICE PORCH.</h4>

<p>Framework of lattice porch is generally the same form as other porches.
The covering is usually made with one-and-three-eighths-inch material,
laid diagonal; openings, one and three-eighths inch. Door and hardware,
same as used for other parts of the house, are generally provided.</p>

<h4>OUTSIDE STEPS.</h4>

<p>Outside steps of wood usually have hard-wood treads made
of seven-eighths-by-two-and-one-half-inch pieces, with three-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> eighths-inch
space between; carriages should be two by ten
inches, about sixteen on centres. Railing and posts for steps
should be provided if necessary. Lattice should be placed under
porches and outside steps, and between all outside piers. Outside
lattice-work in yard may be of the same general design as
mentioned for lattice-work porches.</p>

<p>General statements as to outside wood-work apply alike
to brick or frame houses, with certain omissions that should be
obvious to an intelligent reader.</p>

<h4>INSIDE WOOD-WORK.</h4>

<p>All material should be perfectly clear, first-class, thoroughly
seasoned, kiln-dried, dressed material, free from imperfections
tending to impair its use, durability, strength, or appearance.
All inside finish excepting floors should be sand-papered.
Where an especially good finish is desired, all should be scraped
as well.</p>

<h4>FLOORS.</h4>

<p>In preparing for floors, it is not unusual to make arrangements
for preventing the passage of sound. This is done by
deadening. The usual method is to nail strips about two inches
and a half from the top edge of the joist, on which are laid one-inch
boards. This leaves an inch and a half between their surface
and the upper edge of the joist. This may be filled in with
concrete, mineral wool, or other non-conducting material.
Either is very effective in preventing the passage of sound from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
the floors to the rooms below. In a dwelling-house where two
floors only are in common use, it is only necessary to deaden
the second floor.</p>

<p>A permanent sheathing floor of the same material that is used
for rough siding may be placed over all joists of first and second
floors for a floor during the plastering of the house. This does
not act as deadening, unless concrete or mineral wool be placed
over it. It is well to have a floor of this kind for use during
plastering. It also makes the lower floor warmer. It should
be covered with building-paper before the finished floor is laid.
Finished floors should extend throughout the first and second
stories and the attic. They are commonly of pine or other soft
wood. The material is tongued and grooved, secret-nailed, and
should be smoothed off after laying. The boards should never
be wider than five and a half inches, nor less in thickness than
seven-eighths of an inch. They should be free from sap, large,
loose, or black knots. Hard-wood floors may be of hard pine,
oak, maple, or other hard wood that is readily obtainable or
desirable. This material should not be more than two and three-fourths
inches in width, nor less than seven-eighths of an inch
in thickness, and should be tongued and grooved, secret-nailed,
and smoothed off and scraped after laying. A better grade of
pine flooring than that mentioned may be had if desired. It is
best that all floors be laid after plastering. However, this is not
the common practice. The carpenter should cut out flooring as
directed, and prepare for hearths in proper places. Other inside
dressed wood-work should never be placed in position until after
the plastering is finished and dry.</p>

and shows the kind of lumber, style of doors, finish of wood,
painters&#8217; finish, and rooms supplied with plate glass, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>It may be said, in general terms, in regard to the different
kinds of wood used in finishing a house, that, all things considered,
hard wood of one kind or another is preferable, for the reason that it
stands the general wear and tear of house-keeping with less evidence of
the struggle. Soft wood&mdash;pine or poplar&mdash;is only to be used
because it is cheaper than the other. Quartered oak, quartered sycamore,
cherry, maple, walnut and chestnut may be classed as the hard woods in
ordinary use in finishing houses of moderate cost. Gum is difficult to
class. It is neither hard nor soft. Others might be mentioned in this
same connection. Pine and other resinous woods are mentioned as soft
woods; as is also poplar, called in some sections white-wood. Any of
these woods may be oil-finished, according to the general formula
indicated elsewhere, or any of them may be stained. Birch stains very
nicely.</p>

<h4>DOORS AND FRAMES.</h4>

<p>Door-frames, when rabbeted, should not be less than one
and three-eighths inch in thickness. Sometimes the strip is
screwed to the frame. In that case the frame is often not more
than one and one-eighth inch thick. One and three-eighths
inch, however, is better. Front doors or principal entrance
doors are frequently hard wood when all the others are soft
wood. All outside doors are generally filled with glass in their
upper panels. Sliding doors should be the same general design
as other adjacent doors. One additional panel to each additional
twelve inches in excess of width of other doors may be provided.
Sliding doors should be hung from above. Hard-wood doors
are usually solid. All excepting pine are best made of a veneer,
one-fourth inch thick on a one-and-three-eighths-inch pine body,
as indicated by <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>. Sometimes doors are made in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
thicknesses of hard wood. This is not as good as a single
thickness. Three thicknesses are better. The only door to be
recommended, however, is the veneered door. Such doors will
not warp; others are liable to do so. Transoms may be hung
on pivots, and should be provided with catches, and, if heavy or
high, with adjustable lifts. Transoms are sometimes used in
doors on the second floor, though this practice is less common
than in the past. Where doors with transoms are used, it is not
uncommon to have the closet doors extend to the full height
of the transom tops, and provide additional top panels. Doors
six feet ten inches in height, or less, and not more than one and
three-eighths inch in thickness, may be hung on two three-and-one-half
by three-and-one-half-inch buts. If higher than
this or wider than three feet, they should be hung on three
buts or hinges.</p>

<p>Doors in unfinished cellars may be made of two thicknesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of seven-eighths beaded flooring; frames the same as in rooms above. A
seven-eighths batten door, with one-and-three-eighths-inch frame, should
be provided for man-hole in cellar. Scuttle doors, where required, may
be seven-eighths inch in thickness, battened.</p>

<p>Cuts <a href="#Fig_35">35</a>, <a href="#Fig_36">36</a>, <a href="#Fig_37">37</a> indicate ordinary style of inside door and window
finish, the sizes and heights being marked. Doors from dining-room to
china-closet and china-closet to kitchen should be hung on double-spring
hinges, so that they will swing either way and come back to position.
The slide from the kitchen to china-closet or dining-room should be hung
the same as sash, with plaited cotton sash-cord, pulleys, and weights,
and provided with lifts and bolt fastenings.</p>

<p>Frames should be provided for opening into bay windows, window-seats,
alcoves, and pilasters.</p>

<p>Stop beads for glazed and sliding doors should be secured with
round-headed screws.</p>

<p>There should be corner beads for external angles.</p>

<h4>FLY SCREEN.</h4>

<p>In the modern house all outside openings, from cellar to
attic, are provided with fly screens. They are now made by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
concerns who make it a business to do this work, and are much
better than those made by the ordinary carpenter. They are
arranged so that they will slide up and down on the inside or
outside stop, and are finished in every way to correspond with
the other wood-work of the house. They need not be more than
three-quarters of an inch in thickness if properly made. A small
strip is secured to the stop bead, and a corresponding groove is
cut in the screen frame. A spring therein holds it firm, and
admits of their removal without trouble or waste of time. Special
hardware is provided for door and window screens.</p>

<h4>INSIDE CASINGS.</h4>

<p>The commonest way of constructing casings at this time is
indicated in <a href="#Fig_35">Figs. 35</a> and <a href="#Fig_36">36</a>, showing inside of doors and windows.
This is one of the least expensive forms, and is adapted
to all ordinary work. The casings are usually seven-eighths
inch thick, the corner and plinth blocks one and one-eighth
inch thick. The plinth block comes at the bottom of the casing.
One reason that this form of casing is in such general use is,
that the corner block conceals any slight shrinkage which there
may be in the wood. Where there is a mitred or flush joint,
the shrinkage is certain to show. Casings as elaborate as any
one is inclined to pay for may be used. Window, door, alcove,
and other casings are generally all of one design in a room.
All girders and projections below ceilings should be cased.</p>

<h4>BASE.</h4>

<p>The base-board around the room should be plain, so that it
may be readily cleaned. Where it is ornamented, it adds nothing
to the appearance of the room. There should be a base for
all plastered walls. Generally they should be not more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
eight inches high, seven-eighths inch thick, bevelled at the top
and a quarter round at the bottom. A five-eighths-inch adjustable
lip may be put on at the top, to take up the inequalities in
the plaster. The closet base may be formed of a quarter round
only if it is plastered and skimmed to the floor. It is well to
have as little wood-work as possible in the closet.</p>

<h4>WAINSCOTING.</h4>

<p>Wainscoting kitchen, bath, and other rooms is not as common
as it once was. This is because wood-work is more difficult
to keep clean than plastering. Wherever there is wainscoting,
there must necessarily be joints. These are difficult to
keep clean. Panel wood-work, or other form of decoration for
wall or ceiling, may be used in rooms according to the disposition
of the owner and the taste of the architect.</p>

<h4>INSIDE SHUTTERS.</h4>

<p>Inside shutters are not so universally used in good houses
as they were a few years ago. Draperies, though more expensive,
are preferred, and are taking their place. Inside sliding
shutters, arranged in several sections and constructed according
to the general plan described for fly-screens, are in more
common use. Rolling slats which roll into a pocket are to be
thought of only in connection with an expensive dwelling.
The common inside shutter is ordinarily seven-eighths inch in
thickness, four panels wide, beaded, and cut at the meeting rail;
and the four centre panels are provided with movable slats.
The special designs of inside shutters mentioned are manufactured
by various establishments throughout the country, and are
advertised in various magazines and periodicals. Under any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
circumstances the owner will have to investigate proprietary
goods and special furnishings for himself. They are not to be
considered in a work of this kind.</p>

<h4>WOOD-WORK FOR PLUMBING.</h4>

<p>All should be put up in a way to make plumbing readily
accessible by the removal of screws. The pipe duct should be
located as required in the kitchen, and pass from basement to
attic floor. The inside measurement should be seven by twelve
inches. It should be constructed of seven eighths-inch lumber.
In case of stud partitions, the duct may be let into the wall the
full depth allowed by studding. The front will project into the
kitchen. All should be of clear lumber, the same as other wood
used in finishing. A ventilating opening, five inches in diameter,
may be provided at the top of the duct. This may be connected
with pipe and funnel, or other device, placed over the
kitchen range. The carpenter should provide pipe boards for
all pipe runs. The following, in regard to wood-work for
plumbing, is from the specification of an architect:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Kitchen Sink and Fittings.</span>&mdash;Wood rim, &#8542; by 2&frac12; inches; skirt, &#8542; by
6&frac12; inches; support on cleat at back, plain oak, 1&#8540;-inch turned legs in front.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tables.</span>&mdash;There shall be two tables connected with drain and sink, each
21 inches wide, 2 by 6 inches long, &#8542; thick; skirt, 3 by &#8542; inches. Cleated
back. Secured and supported same as drain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Other Sinks</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cellar Sink.</span>&mdash;Provide &#8542;-by-3-inch supporting rim, 2&frac12; inches by &#8542; inch
top. 1&#8540; square legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bath-tub.</span>&mdash;Case sides and ends with &#8542;-by-2&frac34;-inch oak board, tongued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>and grooved material, secret-nailed. Batten foot-casing, and put in in one
piece with round-headed blue screws. Cap top.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Splash-board.</span>&mdash;Wainscoting same as tub casing, 6 inches high. Cap
top in two members &#8542; inch thick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Water-closet.</span>&mdash;Hinged flap and seat, each &#8542; inch thick; skirt, &#8542; by
5 inches; support on 1&#8540; turned legs in front, cleat at back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wash-stands.</span>&mdash;Provide supports under marble top. Case sides same
as specified for tub. Make cleated door in front of same material. Provide
hinges and fastenings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tank.</span>&mdash;A tank shall be placed in attic; capacity, 8 barrels. Construct
with 1&frac34;-inch ploughed and tongued material, with two &#8540;-inch rods, bolts, and
nuts at each end, and cleats across top at middle.</p>

<p>In this house there shall be the following plumbing fixtures, to be fitted
up as above: 1 kitchen sink, cellar sink, sink, 1 bath-tub, 1 water-closet,
1 wash-stand.</p></blockquote>

<h4>PICTURE MOULDINGS.</h4>

<p>Picture mouldings should be provided on all plastered walls
excepting those of kitchen and pantries. It is usual to place
the picture moulding on a line with the top of the door; that is,
so that it comes just below the top of the corner block.</p>

<h4>CLOSET-FITTINGS.</h4>

<p>Shelves should be seven-eighths inch thick, number and
arrangement as desired.</p>

<p>The following is a schedule from closet-fittings. Provide
hooks in closets as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>One row to cleat on wall 5 feet 3 inches from floor.</p>

<p>One row under side of shelf.</p>

<p>One row to cleat on wall 3 feet 6 inches from floor in children&#8217;s closets.</p></blockquote>

<h4>DRAWERS FOR CLOSETS.</h4>

<p>Drawers for closets are best made by a cabinet-maker. If
not, they should be modelled in all respects after cabinet work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Cedar closets are not as common as they once were. As people
have more to place in them, there is less confidence in their
efficacy. The following is from a specification:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Broom-rack.</span>&mdash;Provide in space as directed 1 broom-rack, with cast-iron
broom-holder, for sweep-broom, whisk-broom; hooks for dust-pan and bucket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Medicine-chest.</span>&mdash;Provide in closet a medicine-chest 8 by 10 by 16
inches, with &#8542; panelled and hinged door. Approved lock.</p>

<p>Exposed wood-work thereof same as room in which closet is placed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cedar-closet.</span>&mdash;Closet shall be lined, ceiled, and fitted up with red
cedar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dry-box.</span>&mdash;Secured on wall adjacent to kitchen range shall be placed
a drying-box for scrub-rags, brushes, etc., 8 inches deep by 18 inches wide by
24 inches high, constructed with &#8542;; material, inside measurements. Provide
hinged &#8542;;-inch panelled door with fastening. Top, bottom, and shelves shall
be perforated with &frac34;-auger-holes for passage of warm air through the box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soap-box.</span>&mdash;Constructed same as dry-box. Size, 9 inches deep, 20
inches wide, 30 inches high.</p>

<p>Door, &#8542;; inch thick, panelled. Provide approved lock. Shelves, &#8541; thick,
set into sides, 3 inches apart. Perforate bottom and shelves with &frac34;-inch auger-holes,
and connect top with kitchen or vent-flue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clock-shelf.</span>&mdash;Provide 8-inch moulded clock-shelf, &#8542; inch thick, in
kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ventilator.</span> <span class="smcap">Clothes-chute.</span> <span class="smcap">Coal-chute.</span> <span class="smcap">Coal-bins in cellar.</span></p></blockquote>

<h4>CHINA-ROOM SPECIFICATION.</h4>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cupboard</span> (see drawing, Chapter VII.).&mdash;Shelves as directed below and
above. Lower shelves &#8542; inch thick.</p>

<p>Lower doors &#8542; panelled, upper doors glazed.</p>

<p>Provide hinges and fastenings for all.</p>

<p>There shall be 8 inches space between &#8542;-inch top of lower section and
bottom shelf of upper section. Upper door shall not come below under side
of this upper section shelf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Table.</span>&mdash;Construction same as in kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sink.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drawers.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<h4>PANTRY SPECIFICATION.</h4>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Cupboard</span> (see drawing, <a href="#Page_51">Chapter VII</a>.).&mdash;As indicated. Doors below
and shelves above, same as specified for china. No doors above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dough-board.</span>&mdash;Provide constructed same as tables specified for kitchen,
except that it shall be supported on brackets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flour-bin.</span>&mdash;Shall be 18 inches deep by 24 inches high in front,
28 inches in rear, by &mdash;&mdash; long, &mdash;&mdash; compartments. Set 4 inches from
floor. Top cleated and hinged. Lumber &#8542; inch thick.</p></blockquote>

<h4>FLOUR-BIN.</h4>

<p>The flour-bin described in the specifications is the old kind
with the hinged top. Another kind that has been used successfully
is here illustrated.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illo_2.png" width="350" height="252" alt="Flour-bin" title="Flour-bin" />
</div>

<p>The receptacle for flour is pivoted in the manner indicated by the
section. The pivot position is indicated on the drawing by the point of
the arrow. The dotted lines on the section indicate the position of the
flour receptacle when it is open. It is pulled open by the hand. The
knob is shown on the drawing of front. As soon as it is released it
falls back into a closed position. It is pivoted so that it remains
closed unless held open. The front drawing indicates a flour-bin of this
kind with three receptacles; the larger one for flour, and the two
smaller ones for meal and graham. The marble dough-stone can be placed
on the top of a bin of this
kind. If there is no other room for the bin it can be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
in the lower section of the pantry cupboard, and can take the
space ordinarily given one of the doors. The pantry cupboard
is illustrated and described in <a href="#Page_51">Chapter VII</a>.</p>

<h4>BOXES FOR PANTRY SUPPLIES.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illo_3.png" width="350" height="156" alt="Pantry Supply Box" title="Pantry Supply Box" />
</div>

<p>These boxes are constructed on the same principle as the flour-bin, just
described. They are pivoted and arranged in a row, and may be set on a
pantry shelf. The drawing indicates eight of these boxes, four of them
nine by twelve inches, and four five by three and three-fourths inches.
These boxes are of tin, the frame only being of wood. The socket into
which the pivot fits is open at the bottom, so that the box can be
lifted off the pivot and taken out and washed. An arrangement such as
this takes very little room, and the boxes are always closed unless held
open. They are so pivoted that they fall into a closed position as soon
as released. Two of these boxes in a china-closet would be convenient to
hold bread and cake.</p>

<h4>STAIRS.</h4>

<p>The wood-work of the stairway should always be of hard
wood. Where hard wood is used for entire finish, the stairway
is best of the same variety. The treads should always be one
and one-eighth inch in thickness, and never less than ten
inches in width. The risers may be seven-eighths inch thick and
never more than seven and one-half inches in height; Square
or turned newel posts are in common use. Winders should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
be used for the main stairway. Square turns at the landing
should be made. Sometimes the rear stairway is of the same
general style and design as the front. When it is an open stairway,
it is necessary that this should be the case. A rear box
stairway, the cellar and attic stairway, or, in fact, any box stairway,
should have the treads and risers the same thickness and
general dimensions as those mentioned for the front. However,
they need not be of hard wood. They should always be provided
with hand-rails. All lumber for cellar or attic stairways
should be clear and dressed, and quite as well finished as that
of any other part of the house. When the cellar is not plastered,
the side lining for cellar stairways should be seven-eighths-inch
flooring below the first-story plastering. This flooring should
be dressed on both sides. The outside cellar-way should have
dressed treads and risers one and three-fourths inch thick.
The wall should be capped, preferably with stone, and the outside
cellar door should be of iron. Where economy is necessary,
one-and-three-fourths-inch oak coping and doors may be used.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>PLASTERING.&mdash;GRAY FINISH.&mdash;WHITE HARD FINISH.&mdash;BACK PLASTERING.&mdash;GAS-PIPING.&mdash;TIN

<p>It is only within the last ten or fifteen years that it has been
at all common to do two-coat work in plastering. Before
that time three-coat work was almost universal. Most of the
plastering done at this time is what is called &#8220;laid-on&#8221; work.
The first two coats are put on at the same time. The last
coat is put on after these are dry. The laths are nearly always
of pine. There should be one nail for each contact with the
wood-work; that is, four nails to each lath. The mortar should
be made of the best quality of lime and sharp sand.</p>

<p>A sufficient quantity of hair should be used. The mortar
should be floated, or made smooth, and straightened to receive
the wood-work. The last coat should be put on after the other
is thoroughly dry. It should be trowelled to a smooth surface,
and when completed should be free from chip cracks, stains, and
improper mixing of sand. Three-coat work, where each coat
is allowed to become thoroughly dry, is better than two-coat
work. The last coat is usually a white plaster-of-Paris finish,
put on with the skim.</p>

<p>A gray finish is used more generally at the present time
than in the past. It is put on in place of the white skim coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>The natural color is a pleasant gray tint. It may be made
smooth enough for papering. The skim coat, white or gray, may
be tinted with fresco color at less cost than it can be papered.
Paper becomes necessary on a white skim finish after a short time.</p>

<p>The hard white finish, which is not commonly used at the
present time, is very satisfactory excepting for its extreme
whiteness. This finish is made by the use of white sand and
skim rubbed and floated down until only a sufficient amount of
the lime or skim proper remains to cement the sand to the wall.
The same kind of a finish with gray sand is very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Proprietary finishes for plastered walls are now used to some
extent in the better class of work. They are very hard, of waterproof
texture and of any color desired. The coloring of finish
for plastering is ordinarily not successful. However, some of the
proprietary colored goods before the public are very satisfactory
when well put on. The one difficulty in the way of their use is
in getting the plasterer to handle properly a thing with which
he is not familiar.</p>

<p>Back plastering is common in very cold climates, and is
done by plastering on the back of the sheathing between the
studding. It is independent of the inside plastering.</p>

<p>Cement pavements in floors are considered in the previous
chapter.</p>

<h4>GAS-PIPING.</h4>

<p>Gas-pipes are placed in a house before lathing. The gas
company which supplies the illuminating or fuel gas furnishes
the inspection for each set of pipes. Below is given a form of
specification in use by an architect in a natural-gas region.</p>

<h4>GAS.</h4>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Illuminating Gas.</span>&mdash;Provide and fix gas-pipe and fittings according to
gas company&#8217;s regulations. All pipes shall be concealed, excepting where it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>is desired to attach a burner. Cap pipes. Lights to be placed as indicated
by table below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fuel or Natural Gas.</span>&mdash;Provide and fix pipe and fittings according to
company&#8217;s regulations. Company&#8217;s certificate of approval will be required
before payments are made. Cap pipes until mixers and burners are attached.</p>

<p>Valves and connections shall be provided preparatory to mixer and
burner connections. Provide connection with street mains.</p></blockquote>

<h4>TIN WORK.</h4>

<p>It is now entirely possible to get first-class tin plate for
architectural uses. The process is very simple. Require and
pay only for a tin plate stamped with a reputable maker&#8217;s name
and brand. There is a general effort upon the part of tin-plate
dealers to raise the standard of tin in this way; and there are
now a number of manufacturers of integrity who are pursuing
the course of branding a first-class tin plate. All tin work
should be painted on the under side before it leaves the shop.</p>

<h4>GUTTERS.</h4>

<p>In the matter of general utility the hanging gutter is ideal.
It is below the eaves, where its overflow can injure nothing. It
is easy to reach all parts of it in case of repair. If it is necessary
to remove any of the shingles or other roof covering, the
gutter need not be disturbed. There are those, however, who
object to the appearance of a hanging gutter. A galvanized
iron gutter made of No. 26 iron, in form as per <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>, and
which runs four inches above the overflow line at all times, may
be placed on the first or second row of shingles or slate, and
will give very good satisfaction. It is certainly much better than
a wood tin-lined gutter.</p>

<h4>VALLEYS AND OTHER TIN WORK.</h4>

<p>All valleys should be lined with twenty-inch tin. The connection
between all roof and vertical surfaces should be flashed
and counter-flashed; that is, pieces of tin should be bent to conform
to the vertical and horizontal surfaces, and slipped under
the slate or shingles so as to lap both horizontally and vertically.
This is the flashing. The counter-flashings are the lapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
pieces of tin which extend into the vertical surfaces, and down
over the flashings proper.</p>

<p>All wood-work which projects in excess of one and three-eighths
inch from any vertical surface, should be covered with
tin. Hip and ridge coping should be covered with tin in the
manner described in chapter where roofs are considered.</p>

<p>Down spouts should be provided to carry the water from all
roofs to the ground. The presence of more than one gable in
the front part of the building frequently makes more than one
down spout necessary. Where the house is not too large, one
five-inch spout will usually take all of the water from the roof.
For a small structure a four-inch spout will serve the same purpose.
Three and four inches are in common use for carrying
water from the main roof where the continuous course of the
gutter is interrupted by gables or dormers. The cistern down-spout
should be provided with cut-off or preferably a switch
spout, which connects by a drain pipe with a dry well or street
gutter. Such connections should never be made with the sewer
where a down spout is intended to supply a cistern. In connecting
a roof with a cistern it should be borne in mind that it
is not always so much the size of the cistern which insures a
constant supply of water, as it is the amount of roof surface
connected with the cistern.</p>

<p>Porches are usually provided with two or three inch down
spouts according to the amount of roof to be drained.</p>

<p>Flat roofs are best when made with a standing seam. It
admits of the expansion and contraction of the tin without injury
to the joint.</p>

<p>Copper has been extensively used on the better class of
buildings during recent years. The improvement in the quality
of tin has rendered its use unnecessary excepting for down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
spouts and ornamental purposes. New processes in the manufacture
of sheet copper, and the electroplating of other sheet
metals with copper, promise to reduce the cost of that material
for architectural purposes, so that it will be better and cheaper
than tin. When such claims are substantiated the public will
be informed thereof, through the usual channels.</p>

<p>Galvanized iron does not have the general architectural uses
that were common to it a few years ago. For down spouts
in excess of four inches, No. 26 galvanized iron should be
used.</p>

<p>Hot-air pipes which connect the furnace pipes in basement
with the second floor are usually three and three-fourths by
twelve inches in size. Before they are placed, all contiguous
wood-work should be lined with tin. In frame houses the pipes
should be covered with iron lath. They should continue above
baseboard, with register opening on second floor and below joist
with collar in basement. Where pipes run in an outside wood
wall, which they should do only in case of extremest emergency,
the back and sides of the pipe should be lined with several
thicknesses of asbestos paper.</p>

<p>A zinc drain should be provided from the refrigerator to the
outside of brick wall. This drain is one inch in diameter, and
comes up through the floor with funnel-shaped opening at the
top. An ordinary six-inch tin funnel let into the tube will
answer every purpose. Thus the discharge pipe from the
refrigerator may be readily placed over it.</p>

<p>Thimbles should be provided for the plasterer when he is
putting on the last coat. Flue stops should be placed therein
after plastering is finished. These are for stove connections
with brick flues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<h4>PAINTING.</h4>

<p>Painting is not so serious a problem as it once was. We
hear about people buying their own paint, the lead and everything
that goes with it, and having it mixed under their personal
supervision. But even this is not satisfactory. After a short
time the paint begins to look chalky and dingy. When the
mixing of the paint is not done under the supervision of the
owner, and the result is as above stated, the painter is often
accused of dishonesty.</p>

<p>A painter does not ordinarily have the facilities or knowledge
for properly mixing colored paints. In order to get satisfactory
results in painting, we may again fall back upon the integrity
of an established manufacturer of proprietary goods,&mdash;that is,
upon ready-mixed paints. Not all are good. Most of them
are made as cheap and common as possible; but the best results
can be secured from really good ready-mixed paints. Any
large dealer of established reputation, who is not himself a manufacturer
of a cheap paint, may ordinarily be relied upon for a
correct opinion.</p>

<p>Preparatory to painting, all knots should be coated with
shellac. All work should be painted with three coats,&mdash;one
priming, and two following. One can always be sure of getting
the color wanted in ready-mixed paints of the best quality. All
outside frames should be primed before setting. The painter
should follow the carpenter, and prime all dressed wood-work
as put up. Putty work may be done after first coat, or before
final color is applied. There is no advantage to be derived in
painting shingles after they are put on. The paint gathers in a
heavy ridge on the shingle next to the butt of the one above it
in a way to let the moisture lie therein, so that it will rot at
this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Brick-work may be painted as specified for wood-work,
excepting that the first coat, or priming, should be put on very
heavy.</p>

<p>Tin and iron work should be painted with one coat of metallic
paint as soon as put up. Tin unexposed to view should
receive a second coat of metallic paint before the building is
completed. Tin work exposed to view should have two coats
of paint on a metallic prime, same as house.</p>

<h4>EXTERIOR STAINING.</h4>

<p>Shingles should be dipped in stain and then stood in a
trough, so that they will drain to a barrel. Other external
wood-work should have two heavy coats of stain applied with a
brush. Weather-boarding is sometimes dipped into a trough
filled with stain, and then set so that it will drain therein.
Shingle stain is a proprietary finish, and regularly advertised
in leading periodicals.</p>

<h4>INTERIOR STAINING.</h4>

<p>The staining of interior finish is now rendered simple and
satisfactory by the use of proprietary stains. Sometimes the
stain is put on direct, without first applying filler. At other
times a filler of cornstarch and oil, or a proprietary mixture,
which is preferable, is used. One or two coats of prepared oil-finish
follows the application of the stain. The various manufacturers
of interior stains furnish wood samples which indicate
the variety of this material manufactured.</p>

<h4>OIL FINISHING.</h4>

<p>All wood to be oil-finished should first be filled. The
antique and acid stained effects are derived by the use of differ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>ent
kinds of fillers, which close the pores of the wood and stain
it the color desired. Proprietary fillers and oil finish may be
most successfully used, for the reason that they are generally
prepared by men who have put their capital into the business
for the purpose of getting a return. Such people cannot put a
bad article permanently on the market without feeling the result
themselves. Therefore, those who are permanently successful in
the manufacture of proprietary goods can generally be relied upon.</p>

<p>In the finishing of wood-work all under coats should be
rubbed with dry hair-cloth, burlap, or fine sand-paper. On top
of the filler two coats of prepared oil finish should be applied;
the first one rubbed as above, and, if desired, the last left bright.
A dead finish may be secured by rubbing down the last coat
with fine pumice stone and water or oil.</p>

<p>External exposed wood-work and bath-rooms may be finished
with a water-proof varnish by treating as above, excepting that
the last coat should be a water-proof oil finish made by some
well-known manufacturer.</p>

<h4>FLOOR FINISH.</h4>

<p>All manufacturers of first-class interior finishes prepare a
special floor finish. It is usually applied in two coats over
a filler as described. In such cases the filler is not stained.
Each coat is thoroughly rubbed. A satisfactory floor finish may
be made by washing the clean wood floor with a solution of salt
and water, and afterwards saturating with paraffine wax, and
then rubbing.</p>

<h4>GLAZING.</h4>

<p>All glass should be embedded in putty and secured with
glazier&#8217;s tacks and putty. American sheet glass is made in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
thicknesses&mdash;single and double strength&mdash;and in four qualities.
<i>A</i> or <i>AA</i> only should be used in a good house.</p>

<p>Plate glass costs about five or six times as much as double-strength
<i>A</i> American sheet. A thumb rule for calculating the
cost of plate glass, which is not strictly accurate but which gives
a general idea, is to calculate on from fifty to seventy-five cents
per square foot.</p>

<h4>CATHEDRAL GLASS.</h4>

<p>Of cathedral glass proper there is only one quality. In ornamental
and colored glass work the different kinds of glass
used will not be here enumerated. Bevelled plate is becoming
quite common. Generally speaking, cathedral glass may be
arranged in geometrical forms in sash with wood separations
or muntins. Cathedral glass proper for such purposes costs
from twenty-five to thirty-five cents a square foot. Cathedral
glass leaded may cost almost any amount in excess of a dollar
per square foot. In selecting cathedral glass for sash with
wood separations, the best and most satisfactory results may be
reached by choosing the lighter tints, and not having more than
one or two colors to the window.</p>

<h4>HARDWARE.</h4>

<p>It is difficult if not impossible to write a general specification
for the hardware which goes into a house. It cannot be done
excepting by specifying particular goods, which cannot be done
here. However, a few general statements in regard to hardware
may not be amiss. The cheapest locks used should have
brass fronts and bolts, and be of the mortise pattern. Night-locks
should be provided as desired. Outside knobs of rear
door and those inside the kitchen may be of bronzed iron.
The price of bronzed-faced locks is not much greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
brass-faced locks. A good bronzed-iron knob has not been
made up to this time. Therefore, the fixtures for the front door,
if not all others, should be of real bronze.</p>

<p>Butts of bronzed iron have been made which are very satisfactory.
Sash locks should be provided for all windows.
Sliding-door hardware should be of real bronze. The locks
should be what is known as &#8220;astragal&#8221; fronts, and the trimmings
flush. Sliding doors should be suspended from above
on hangers. Bolts of wrought-iron should be placed on all outside
rear doors, and, if desired, on the inside of all chamber and
bedroom doors; always on the bath-room door. Such bolts
may be mortised or otherwise, as desired. Foot and top bolts
may be provided for double doors and for sash. Pivots should
be provided for all transoms; transom lifts as desired, also
sash lifts. There should be wooden base knobs with rubber
buffers at all doors. Double-spring hinges should be provided
for doors leading to and from kitchen and china-closet or passage.
Necessary drawer hardware should be provided, and
butts, knobs, and fastenings for inside shutters.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h3>

FOR PLUMBER.&mdash;WATER DISTRIBUTION.&mdash;OUTSIDE FIXTURES.&mdash;HYDRANTS.&mdash;STREET-WASHERS.&mdash;SOFT-WATER
SUPPLY.&mdash;HOT-WATER SUPPLY.&mdash;SOIL PIPE.&mdash;INSIDE FIXTURES.&mdash;KITCHEN

<p>In a previous chapter plumbing was considered from a sanitary
standpoint, and the conditions of safety set forth. In
this chapter it remains to consider plumbing work in a more
practical way; to consider it with reference to its execution,
assuming that it is desired to reach the best results. This
means, primarily, good work; then good work with the least
expenditure of money.</p>

<p>The carpenter usually provides all necessary wood-work
for the plumber. This means boards and runs on which pipes
are to be placed, the pipe duct and other wood finish. It is
best that the carpenter should do this in order that it may be
well done. There should be specified in the carpenter&#8217;s contract
exactly what he is to do, so that he may calculate on a definite
basis. All of the cutting work, where cutting is necessary,
should be done by the carpenter. The plumber is not usually
supplied with tools of the right kind for doing this, and is as
liable to botch carpenter work as a carpenter would be to botch
the plumbing work.</p>

<p>The plumber should do all of his own excavating. This
includes trenches for pipes of all kinds to and from the
house. After the pipes and drains have been placed therein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
he should make fills and thoroughly tamp the earth so as to
restore the surface to its original condition. This may be best
done by putting in a small quantity of earth at a time, ramming
it down and then pouring water on it. Even after this
the drain space should be left with a slight crown, as the
earth will settle a little more than it is possible to make it
by artificial means. Superfluous earth should be removed from
the building and lot.</p>

<p>Plumber&#8217;s excavating is not included in the general contract.
If there is any superfluous earth in connection with his work, he,
and not the general contractor, should remove it. Contracting
methods are explained in another section of the book.</p>

<h4>WATER DISTRIBUTION.</h4>

<p>Lead should be used for all purposes where pipes are exposed
to view and where they come in contact with the earth. This is
common practice. Sometimes, however, brass or planished
copper pipes and fittings are used where they are exposed to
view. Brass makes very beautiful and satisfactory work. Iron
pipe, galvanized inside and out, is occasionally used for exposed
work. It does not look as well, however, as lead pipe. Galvanized
iron pipe is also frequently used where not exposed to
view, and where it does not come in contact with the earth.
Objections will be made to this by plumbers who are used to
doing lead work. In all hospitals where the best work is done
iron or brass pipe is used, and lead pipe and connections are
entirely dispensed with. However, the use of lead pipe where
exposed to view and where in contact with the earth, and iron
pipe galvanized for other places, makes most excellent and
beautiful work for dwelling-houses. The connections between
iron and lead pipe should be of brass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
The water works of many cities and towns are from direct-pressure
mains. It is common for such pressure to be forty
pounds to the square inch under ordinary conditions. A fire
pressure is much greater. Therefore, all direct-pressure pipes
of lead should be extra strong. Tank-pressure pipes, those
which connect with a tank in the attic or above a water-closet,
may be medium strong. The terms &#8220;extra strong&#8221; and &#8220;medium
strong,&#8221; as here used, are definite in their meaning, and
apply to regular grades of pipe. The interior fixtures of an
ordinary dwelling-house are supplied with lead pipe five-eighths
of an inch in diameter, or iron pipe three-quarters of an inch in
diameter. In the above will be found all that applies in general
terms to an ordinary specification for water distribution. Special
mention will be made later.</p>

<p>Stop-cocks should be provided sufficient entirely to disconnect
and drain all pipes, fixtures, and connections. &#8220;Stop-and-waste&#8221;
cocks should be provided at the bottom of all main
risers where they cannot otherwise be drained. A &#8220;stop-and-waste&#8221;
cock is one which shuts off the supply from its source,
and drains the water from pipes above, so that it passes out to a
receptacle provided for that purpose. In some instances it is
allowed to run to a sink on the cellar floor, or it may be taken
in a bucket.</p>

<p>The city water-supply for an ordinary dwelling-house is generally
through five-eighths-inch extra strong lead pipe, and is
provided with a stop-box so that the water can be turned off
from the house at the street.</p>

<h4>OUTSIDE FIXTURES.</h4>

<p>Outside fixtures which connect with the city water are a
street-washer and a hydrant. The street-washer is usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
placed in front, so that a hose may be attached to it for sprinkling
purposes. There are many standard grades of street-washers
carried in stock by all plumbers. The hydrant has
about the same lower connections as the street-washer. The
hose connection and opening stand well above the lot grade.
It is usually placed in the back yard or stable. The outlet
may have a hose coupling, and thus be used for sprinkling
purposes in the back part of the lot or otherwise, as desired.
Where there are no hydrants, it is common to run an iron pipe
along the ground to connect the front and back yard. Thus it
is not necessary to have so large a supply of hose. The pipe
thus used is three-quarters of an inch in diameter. It is less
expensive than rubber hose, and does not deteriorate. It should
have a short hose connection in front, and hose coupling at the
back.</p>

<h4>SOFT-WATER SUPPLY.</h4>

<p>In many cities the water from the public pipes contains too
much lime to be used for bathing or washing. In such a case
it is necessary to supply cistern water for that purpose. This
is done by connecting the cistern in the yard with a tank
in the attic, or some place above the highest fixture. To do
this a force pump is placed in the kitchen. The best kind
to use are those known as double-acting, horizontal, brass-cylinder
force pumps. They may be screwed to the floor, and the
handle come up next to the sink or between the drain-board and
the dry-board. When not in use, this handle can be next to
the wall and out of the way. A motor may be used in lieu of a
pump. It is placed over the kitchen sink, and has connection
with city water works. When it is desired to pump water to the
attic, one can turn on the city water at the cock and let it run.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Thus the city pressure is exerted through the motor to pump
water to the attic, and the labor of pumping entirely done away
with. The cost is about fifteen dollars more than a good pump.
The suction of such a pump or motor should be one-and-one-half-inch
strong lead pipe, and the supply to tank in attic one-and-one-quarter-inch
lead or iron pipe where not exposed to view.
Where the pump or motor is placed as indicated, it may be used
to pump water directly to the kitchen sink, and it is generally
best that such an arrangement be made. Of course, water may
be drawn from the tank in the attic to this sink, if it is desired
to so arrange it; but where this is done, it is necessary to pump
all of the cold water used in the kitchen to the attic. This is
unnecessary. The sink may have a direct pump connection by
means of a five-eighths-inch strong lead pipe which connects
with the tank supply. On the end of this lead pipe may be a
brass or nickel compression cock over the sink. When it is
desired to pump water into the tank this cock is closed, and the
only connection is with the tank above.</p>

<p>The common size for tank is eight barrels capacity. It
should be constructed of inch-and-three-quarters ploughed and
tongued material with two three-eighths inch rods, with bolts
and nuts at each end, and cleats across top and bottom in middle.
The inside should be lined with four-pound sheet lead;
that is, sheet lead which weighs four pounds to the foot. There
should be an inch tell-tale pipe of galvanized iron which connects
with the sink nearest the pump. Sometimes an overflow which
runs to the roof is used, in which case a smaller tell-tale, say
one-half inch in diameter, will serve. There are instances
where the tank in the attic is connected with a special gutter on
the roof, above the line of the tank. Then the tank is provided
with a large overflow so that it may not cause trouble. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
this is a little risky. The tank is connected with the hot and
cold water system and fixtures subsequently named.</p>

<p>The hot-water system is as simple as it is efficient. Usually
a heavy-pressure galvanized-iron boiler, of from twenty-four to
sixty-two gallons capacity, is located in the kitchen. It is connected
with the tank by means of five-eighths-inch lead or three-quarters-inch
iron pipe, and with fixtures subsequently named
as being supplied with hot water in the same manner. The
water is heated in the range by means of a water back or water
front placed in the fire-box of the range. It is connected with
the boiler by means of five-eighths-inch lead and three-quarters-inch
iron pipe. One pipe from the lower part of the boiler
takes the water to the back. The other carries it to the top of
the boiler, the cold water naturally going to the bottom and
the hot water passing to the top. The hot-water supply for
fixtures is drawn from the top of the boiler. Any one may
notice, by passing the hand up and down a boiler of this kind,
that the top is always warmer than the bottom. Sometimes a
wrought-iron pipe is used in a stove in lieu of a water back. It
usually answers the same purpose, though its heating surface
is not so great. It is best to use a pipe back where the boiler is
not connected with soft water. The incrustation from the lime
is such that the back soon becomes filled, and it is much more
expensive to replace than one made of pipe. When the hot
water is from the city water works, the supply is usually directly
therefrom rather than from a tank in the attic. However, it is not
uncommon to have a tank supply in the house where public-water
supply is taken to the exclusion of all other, and it is
a better system, though a little more expensive. The hot-water
reservoir is usually placed on an iron stand near the stove. It
should be provided with a draining connection for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
of drawing out all the water when desired. A vent connection
from the reservoir to the tank in attic, or, in the event of no
tank being used, to the roof above, is common as a guard
against extra steam pressure.</p>

<h4>SOIL PIPE.</h4>

<p>Before considering other inside fixtures and fittings, the soil
pipe should be mentioned. It is of cast-iron, light weight, and,
when it is connected with a water-closet, should be four inches
in diameter on the inside, and japanned inside and out. Joints
are made at the hubs, and should be leaded and well calked.
Connections with this pipe should be made by means of Y&#8217;s of
proper size, depending on the size of the drain which connects
therewith. The soil pipe should continue upward and through
the roof to a point at least four feet above the nearest ridge.
Below, it should continue outside of the foundation wall to connect
with the drain. Where there is a sink in the cellar, the
soil pipe should be below the cellar floor. Vitrified or earthenware
drain pipe should never be used inside the walls of a
house.</p>

<h4>INSIDE FIXTURES.</h4>

<p>The kitchen sink may be considered first. They are usually
of light cast-iron. Sometimes they are of pressed steel; again,
they are of cast-iron with an interior porcelain finish. If a common
cast-iron sink is painted, the paint soon wears off. The
ideal sink, the one which is the best in every way, is of porcelain.
It has the white, glazed surface of a fine dish, and is easily
cleaned. Any kitchen sink should be eighteen inches wide, six
inches deep, and from twenty-four to thirty-six inches in length.
Thirty or thirty-six is the best. They are provided with a
strainer in the bottom, and have one-and-one-half-inch light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
lead &#8220;S&#8221; trap connection with soil pipe or grease sink, subsequently
considered. Where city water is at hand, the sink
should be supplied through a five-eighths-inch brass or nickel-plated
self-closing cock. Where the city water is hard, hot and
cold cistern water in addition to city water should be supplied
through five-eighths-inch brass or nickel-plated compression
cocks. If the hot water is from the public water works, a
self-closing cock should be used. All cocks should be screwed
to a soldered nipple, and not &#8220;wiped&#8221; or joined directly to the
lead pipe. In this way, it is not necessary to wipe a joint every
time the cock gives out. A smaller sink, size as desired, may
be used in the china-closet or butler&#8217;s pantry. Such a sink is
not in common use excepting in the more expensive houses.</p>

<p>The cellar sink should be sixteen by sixteen inches, ten inches
deep, and should be provided with strainer, and an inch-and-a-half
light lead &#8220;S&#8221; trap connection with soil pipe. If city supply
only is desired, it may be had through five-eighths-inch brass
self-closing cock. Where connection is made with cistern, it
may be by means of one-and-one-half inch pipe and a cast-iron
pitcher pump; if not this, a well, driven or otherwise, may be
similarly connected by means of a pitcher or lift pump. This
cellar sink is the kind that may be used in connection with the
laundry previously described. Where stationary tubs are used,
this sink is not necessary.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>PLUMBING WORK CONTINUED.&mdash;BATH-TUBS.&mdash;BATH-SPRINKLERS.&mdash;FOOT-TUBS.&mdash;SAFES.&mdash;WATER-CLOSETS.&mdash;WASH-STANDS.&mdash;LAUNDRY
FITTINGS.&mdash;SET TUBS.&mdash;OUTSIDE DRAINS.&mdash;GREASE

<p>The fittings of kitchen and other sinks are fully considered in
<a href="#Page_31">Chapter V.</a>, which has to do with kitchens and pantries.
It is sufficient to say, however, that the only visible wood-work
is the rim and wooden legs, which support the sink proper, and
the splash-boards at the side tables as described.</p>

<h4>BATH-TUBS.</h4>

<p>A great deal might be said on this subject, which must be
left unsaid for the want of space. The ideal bath-tub, the one
which in every way is the most satisfactory, is made of porcelain,
same as the sinks described. They are beautiful in appearance,
easily cleaned, and altogether very satisfactory. However,
they are expensive. For the tub alone the cost is about
one hundred dollars more than for one of copper. They are
used in houses where the matter of cost is not of great importance.
Cast-iron, porcelain-lined, and cast-iron tubs, painted,
are used occasionally in dwellings. They are more expensive
than the copper tubs. An iron porcelain-lined tub is much
less expensive than solid porcelain, and is very satisfactory.
The iron and porcelain tubs do not require side or end casings
of wood. They stand clear of wall and floor. As is known,
tubs are of varying sizes and forms, the usual length being from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
four and one-half to six feet. The tubs known as the &#8220;French&#8221;
pattern are commonly four and one-half feet long, and deeper
and wider than the ordinary copper tub. The weight of the
copper varies from nine to sixteen ounces to the foot; fourteen-ounce
copper tubs are in most general use. The French
pattern of tub is coming into more general use than the others
in the best class of work. As stated before, it is wider and
deeper, though shorter than the old six-foot tub of the common
pattern. It does not require as much water to get the same
depth in the shorter tub as in one that is longer. As no one
cares to lie down in the bath-tub, six feet in length is not
necessary; four and one-half feet is ample.</p>

<p>The ordinary fixtures which go with a bath-tub of moderate
cost are the combination bath-cock with rubber hose and sprinkler,
and a plug and chain. All the metal work is nickel-plated. A
combination bath-cock connection with hot and cold water mixes
the water as it passes into the tub, so that the proper temperature
may be secured by the adjustment of the valves.</p>

<p>The most objectionable feature to the tub of general construction
is the overflow which connects with the waste. It is
simply a tube which has a single opening below the bath-cock
to the waste pipe. This soon becomes foul. Various ingenious
devices have been arranged for doing away with this kind of
overflow. Arrangements are provided which connect directly
with the outlet, and which may be readily removed and cleaned.
These prevent the passage of water to the drain when tub is in
use. By a movement of a handle in the top the passage may
be opened below to allow the water to pass out. There are
many devices constructed on this principle. In some instances
they add only two or three dollars to the cost of the plumbing
outfit, and are certainly worth the extra expense. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
arrangements where the finish is more elaborate, the details
more complete, and the cost largely in excess of the figure here
named. The same device applies to the various tubs, porcelain,
iron, or copper. Formerly it was common to have a large
sprinkler connected with hot and cold water above the tub; this
is now unusual. It was impossible to use this sprinkler without
wetting the head. For that reason the hose and sprinkler has
largely taken its place in ordinary work. However, the sprinkler
is a very good thing, though it is not put in excepting where
the hose attachment is also supplied.</p>

<p>Another modern arrangement which has to do with the
sprinkler is a surrounding rubber curtain, which is supported by
a plated ring on a level with one&#8217;s head when standing. This
prevents the splashing of water out of the tub. It goes against
the curtain, and is thus deflected into the tub. Various arrangements
on this principle, looking to hot or steam baths, have
been devised. They surround the person bathing, leaving only
the head exposed, and discharge the warm water into the confined
space surrounding the body. This is a makeshift to take
the place of hot and steam baths. In some instances, one-third
of the foot end of the tub is fitted with a copper-lined
enclosure on three sides, with shower at top. One may stand
in this space and use the shower as with the curtain. Additions
are sometimes made to this arrangement, wherein the side spray
or needle bath is provided. It is so called from the needle size
of the streams, which are emitted from certain pipes. All of
these showers are connected with regulating valves, so that any
desired temperature of water may be maintained by proper
adjustment. In some very elaborate bath-rooms showers are
provided at the side of the room where there is a marble floor
and marble wall surface. These things are arranged with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
multiplicity of detail, showing the ingenuity of people who have
given these matters much study, and which cannot be fully considered
in this connection. Foot-tubs, with hot and cold water
connections, are made of the same material that is used in bath-tubs,
but are not considered in the plans furnished in this book,
though they may be used at will. The bath-tub will serve the
same general purpose. As stated, the bath-tubs connect with
hot and cold water; they connect with soil pipe or drain by
means of one-and-one-half-inch light lead waste pipe, which
is trapped by means of an &#8220;S&#8221; or other trap.</p>

<h4>SAFES.</h4>

<p>A safe is simply a lead pan which may be placed under the
bath-tub, or other enclosed fixture, to guard against accidents
from overflow or leakage. They are made of four-pound
sheet lead, and are usually turned up from two to four inches
all around. The lead is formed to a bevelled strip at the sides
and end, the size of the pan being that of the extreme outside of
the fixture. There is usually an inch waste connection to the
cellar or kitchen sink. It would be highly improper to connect
a safe with the drain, trapped or otherwise, as its use under any
circumstances will be occasional, and any water that there might
be in the trap would be certain to evaporate, and in that way
the safe waste would be the means of connecting the foulness
of the drain with the house. Therefore, it is right and proper
that it should connect with the sink or the cellar floor. In that
way, any discharge therefrom would be readily noticed. Wastes
are frequently placed under bath-tubs, generally under wash-stands,
when they are enclosed, but rarely or never under a
modern water-closet. They are frequently dispensed with
entirely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<h4>WATER-CLOSETS.</h4>

<p><a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, page 68, indicates, in perspective and in section, the
more common form of water-closet now in use, than which
nothing-better has been devised. The details of the valve connection
and general form of the closet itself, and the means of
flushing it, are various, but the general principle is the same.
It is nothing more or less than a large bowl having an &#8220;S&#8221; trap
connection with soil pipe. The bowl and trap are of white porcelain
ware, in one piece. The form, as here shown, is a washout
closet, and is the one in most general use. Usually a connection
with public water service is provided from a tank above.
Trap vent, as shown, is connected with the outer air above the
roof. The seat of the closet is usually supported from the wall
at the back, and rests on the body of the porcelain, on rubber
buffers, which prevent the liability of breakage or noise, if it
falls. Under any circumstances, water-closets should never be
enclosed.</p>

<h4>WASH-STANDS.</h4>

<p>It has been said that wash-stands are the most dangerous
fixtures that go into a house, and for that reason the greatest
care should be observed in their construction. The only material
of which the bowl proper, for use in a dwelling-house,
should be made is porcelain. The usual form is circular, and
about fourteen inches in diameter. However, they are made in
various forms. The details of their construction differ as greatly
as those of the other fixtures which have been named. Bowls
are made which have the same &#8220;patent&#8221; overflow arrangements
as the bath-tub overflows that have been considered and
described elsewhere. It is usual, however, to use a rubber plug
and chain. The top and back of the wash-stand should be of
marble. The top should be one and one-eighth inch thick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
counter-sunk, so that the splashed water cannot run from it to
the floor; the back need be only seven-eighths inch thick, and
generally not more than ten inches high. Sometimes it may be
less. The hot and cold water fixtures are nickel-plated; usually
they are made self-closing, to prevent the waste of water. It is
necessary that they should be so where city water is used. It
is part of the city regulations that all connections of this kind
be self-closing. Wash-stands need not be enclosed below. The
marble top may be supported on iron brackets or turned wooden
legs of hard wood. Traps and other drain connections can be
neatly arranged so that their appearance is not in any sense
objectionable in the bath-room or other place. The wash-stand
should have one-and-one-half-inch light lead trapped connection
with the drain or soil pipe.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it is not necessary for the trap to be
ventilated, unless it so happen that it is some distance from the
soil pipe or drain. The soil pipe, we know, is always ventilated,
and if the wash-stand is situated some distance from it, it should
have a direct communication with the outer air above the roof.</p>

<p>Sometimes a pitcher-cock is placed on the wash-stand in
the bath-room to enable the drawing of drinking water when the
other connections are with the cistern, it being assumed in this
instance that only the water from public water works is used for
drinking purposes. The pitcher-cock is simply one with a long
neck which extends above the bowl, and is directed into it, the
pitcher being placed under it for the purpose of filling.</p>

<h4>LAUNDRY FITTINGS.</h4>

<p>The fittings for a simple laundry apparatus, that would go
into a house of very moderate cost, have been described elsewhere.
In this instance we will consider only the more elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
arrangements which have to do with set tubs. They may be
of porcelain or plain cast-iron, of cast-iron porcelain-lined, or
of brown glazed earthenware. The porcelain is of the same
general character as that mentioned for the bath-tub and sinks,
and is an expensive and very elegant material. The porcelain-lined
iron tubs are in more general use, for the reason that they
are less expensive than those of all porcelain. Brown earthenware
tubs are coming to be favorably considered, and are in
every way satisfactory. Tubs made of wood, slate, or other
material, where they are in several pieces, are objectionable.
Those mentioned above are one-piece tubs, and are generally
set three together. The porcelain or brown earthenware tubs
usually have wooden rims. Sometimes these tubs are provided
with covers, though it is usual and preferable that covers be not
used, and that the water be supplied from above. The hot
and cold water fixtures are nickel-plated compression cocks,
which connect with hot and cold water sources. Generally
speaking, it is best, where set tubs are used, that an independent
apparatus for heating water be provided; that is, a laundry
water heater, of which there are many different kinds, and which
are constructed on the same general principle as the arrangement
mentioned in connection with the kitchen and other water-heating
apparatus. It is entirely possible, however, to make
connections with the water-heating apparatus of the kitchen.</p>

<p>The drain connections are of one-and-one-half-inch light lead,
and are independently trapped for each tub. They lead to the
main drain, connecting with sewer or vault.</p>

<h4>OUTSIDE DRAINS.</h4>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<a id="Fig_38" name="Fig_38"></a>
<img src="images/fig_38.png" width="250" height="173" alt="Fig. 38" title="Fig. 38" />
</div>

<p>Drains outside of the house should be of vitrified or glazed
earthenware pipe, laid below the action of frost, with proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
slant. They should be well bedded and have smoothly cemented
joints. The slant need be very slight, eighteen inches in
eighty feet or less may be used. It is especially desirable that
the joints be thoroughly cemented, and that they be smooth on
the inside, so that the foul matter passing
through the interior will not lodge against
any projections. The surface or ends of
the pipe should never be clipped or cut for
connections; &#8220;Y&#8217;s&#8221; or &#8220;T&#8217;s&#8221; are used for
all connections with other drains. Drain pipes from a dwelling-house
are usually five or six inches in diameter. It
is quite as important that they be not too large as that they
be large enough. Where a pipe is too large, there is not
enough water in the bottom to keep it clean. The illustration
here given will make clear this point. A six and eight inch
drain is shown with the same quantity of water in each. It is
common in cases of drain connection with a vault that no trap in
the drain or soil pipe itself be used. Where sewer connection
is made, a vitrified trap of the same size as the drain is used;
and it is provided with a trap vent connection with the outer air
by means of vitrified vent and grate opening at the top.</p>

<p>Storm-water connections may be made with the main sewer,
but it is best that they be made between the house and the trap
of main drain. In this way there is no danger of the sewer
having connection with the down spouts in the event of the
evaporation of the water in the trap of the storm-water
connection. The modern plan of city sewer systems is to
have independent service for storm water and house drain
connections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<h4>GREASE SINKS.</h4>

<p>The grease sink is lined with brick, and is usually of four or
five barrels capacity. It is cemented the same as the cistern,
is generally twenty or twenty-five feet away from the house, and
has a four-inch vitrified drain connection with the waste from
the kitchen sink or other sink in which greasy water may be
deposited. The sink itself has a siphon connection with the
main drain or vault, and, being provided with an iron top, the
deposit of grease or other material may be removed if necessary.
In some instances a sink of this kind is required to be used to
collect all solid matter before the drainage connection passes
from the property.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The &#8220;S&#8221; trap only has been distinctly mentioned. There
are hundreds of others, all constructed upon the same general
principle. Some are provided with mechanical means of closing
the opening leading to the source of supply, and, in addition to
this, they are provided with a seal of water depending upon
some form or condition of the &#8220;S&#8221; trap. This principle is
invariable in the construction of traps. No trap should be used
unless provided with a trap screw of the same size as the drain
itself, which will admit of its being opened when necessary. It
is not uncommon that rings or other jewelry get into the waste
of wash-stand or bath-tub; they may be recovered by taking
out the trap screw. Again, should the trap become fouled or
clogged, the matter may be removed in the same way.</p>

<h4>NICKEL FITTINGS.</h4>

<p>For the kitchen sink, nickel fittings are preferable to brass,
because they are more easily cleaned.</p>

<p>Everything that goes into a house should be fully represented
to the owner. Thus the costs may be fixed and the aggregate
understood. If this were universally done, there would be less
said about the unreliability of architects&#8217; estimates. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
architect is very careful to make known to the owner the quality
of everything that he is to have, and, as well, the general quantities
and costs, he is doing his full duty in this matter. Anything
less than this is a neglect of duty. Furthermore, this
should be made a matter of record, so that if changes are made
and the cost altered, a basis for comparison may be at hand. It
is the practice of the writer to use a specification which describes
everything which may be a part of a brick or a frame house, and
to stamp out the parts omitted. For example, in that specification
there are specified brick and cemented floors for cellar. It
is the custom to stamp the word &#8220;No&#8221; before the words brick
floor, so that it reads &#8220;No brick floor in cellar.&#8221; In other cases
it may be &#8220;No lattice work in side yard,&#8221; etc. Thus the owner
of the house knows not only what he is to get, but what he is
not to get, and the exact quality of that which is included as well
as that which is omitted. He has positive and negative information
with respect to his house. This form of specification has
been in use three years, and has been uniformly satisfactory.</p>

<p>The schedule filled out for Mr. Smith is a printed form,
which is handed to the owner as soon as the building cost is
determined. It is in addition to the detailed specification. In the
schedule the cost of the building is put down at three thousand
dollars. The appurtenances are the items mentioned below the
line which gives the price of the building proper, and in this
instance are estimated at $1,128. The house estimate is $3,000.
This makes a total cost of $4,128. The house was a well-finished
building of nine rooms. The parlor and hall were finished
in quartered oak, the dining and sitting rooms in quartered
sycamore, the rear hall in quartered oak, the china-room in
sycamore, kitchen and pantry in plain oak. It would have cost
about $125 less to finish the first floor of this house in soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
wood. It is not possible to give general statements as to
the difference in cost of finishing between hard and soft wood.
Twenty to thirty-five dollars a room is generally ample, though
the difference may be greater.</p>

<p>The privy building was figured at twenty dollars, and the
vault at a dollar a foot. The cistern and connections at fifty
cents a barrel. Thus a hundred-barrel cistern costs fifty dollars.
The well pump, which was located in the kitchen, was a cheap
form of horizontal force-pump fastened to the floor, with the
handle coming up near the kitchen table. It supplied water to
the kitchen sink. It, as well as the cistern pump, was included
in the plumbing contract. The walks were ordinary brick walks
laid in sand. Tight-board fence was figured, as shown, at
twenty-five cents a lineal foot. The illuminating-gas pipe was
figured at a little less than the price given on schedule &#8220;B,&#8221;
but was ample. The same may be said of the plumbing work.
The gas fixtures were neat brass goods that looked plain in the
store surrounded with very elaborate ones, but were entirely
satisfactory when in the house. The mantels and grates, as
may be judged by their cost, were not very elaborate. However,
they were of wood, the same style and finish as the room.
There were bevelled-glass mirrors above the shelves. The hearth
and facing were of unglazed tile, the grate-frame of brass, the
grate itself club pattern, and altogether it was simple but pleasing.
The furnace was of wrought-iron, riveted joints, with galvanized
iron jacket. It would have cost about fifteen or twenty
dollars more to set it in brick. This price included registers,
pipes in the wall, and all connections. If the building had
cost a thousand dollars more, or even two thousand, the appurtenances
need not have cost more than a hundred to a hundred
and fifty dollars additional. There would probably have been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
little more gas pipe, a few more fixtures, and the furnace would
have been somewhat more expensive; or, if the house had cost
five hundred dollars less, the appurtenances would not have
represented in all more than seventy-five dollars difference, providing
the general requirements had been the same.</p>

<p>The following schedule was prepared for Mr. Brown. His
was an eight-room house; smaller, less elaborate, but just as well
built, as the one for Mr. Smith. He did not have quite as much
plumbing, and reduced the other appurtenances somewhat.
Altogether they represent $801. If his had been a fifteen-hundred-dollar
house, and the same general conditions had been met,
the appurtenances would not have cost any less. Likewise, if it
had been a two-thousand-dollar house, they would have cost no
more. Additions to size of rooms or a more elaborate finish
would not have appreciably affected the cost of the appurtenances.
It is well to bear this in mind when building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>The two examples given show the method of filling out
a cost schedule, which, by the way, is seldom presented in
this form to the owner of a house by his architect. It now
remains to indicate, in general terms, the basis of values as before
given. It is not intended to form this book on the &#8220;every-man-his-own-architect&#8221;
principle, but it is constructed on the idea
that every one should know as much about the business in hand
as is possible, before calling for other assistance. For this purpose
certain prices are given which are a little in advance of
those charged in the section of country to which they apply.
This is done so that the errors, if any, may be on the side of
safety. Generally speaking, there will not be any great difference
in the cost of the appurtenances mentioned. It is the cost
of the building proper which varies. The cost of the buildings
illustrated is given, unless otherwise mentioned, on a basis of
hard-wood finish for the first floor excepting kitchen, and soft
wood above, all finished in oil.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>VARYING BUILDING VALUES.&mdash;COST OF APPURTENANCES.&mdash;PRICES
OF LABOR AND MATERIAL ON WHICH ESTIMATES ARE BASED.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>The cost of building varies in different sections. At the
end of this chapter will be found a list of prices upon
which the building estimates of this book are based.</p>

<p>The plumbing schedule is formed so that one may see
about what the different items of a completed plumbing outfit
cost. Figuring sixty feet of service and seventy feet of
drain, the plumbing outfit would cost, as indicated, $328. It
has been furnished for less. The figures given in connection
with plumbing work are not necessarily accurate. They are
approximately so in detail. As no two plumbers or other
mechanics will figure exactly the same on the same fixtures, or
the same material and labor, it is not to be expected that an
architect could form a thumb-rule schedule which would be satisfactory
to plumbers and all others. In the class of work contemplated
in this specification, the tendency of these figures is
in the right direction. They are as nearly correct as general
statements can be. It is known that a single bath-tub can be
fitted up to cost more than the entire plumbing outfit here mentioned.
It would afford no more conveniences to the occupant
of the house, and would be no safer from a sanitary standpoint;
and it probably would require more labor to care for than the
one contemplated. The estimates are on the basis of a specification
which would meet with the approval of the public
sanitary inspectors in any of the large cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>Where there is a material reduction in the number of fixtures
and connections from the list given, the percentage for other
piping and connections will have to be increased.</p>

<p>There are various ways of reducing the cost of the outfit.
The best way is to have less of it; for instance, only city water
may be used, or, possibly, only the cistern water. The completed
plumbing outfit mentioned in schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; with the
exception of cistern-water connections, including hot and cold
city water for sink, wash-stand, and bath-tub, has been put in, in
plan <a href="#Plan_30">No. 30</a>, for $245.</p>

<p>The natural-gas-piping figure, like the others, is liable to
vary. Piping for five fires has been put in for $20, for $15,
and for $30. The burners, the burner valves and mixers, usually
cost from four to five dollars a fire.</p>

<p>The gas-fixture schedule is priced by the burner, not by the
connection. Each burner of each fixture is counted. Of course
one may get a single fixture which will cost as much as the
above rule would figure on a whole outfit, but that is unusual in
moderate-cost houses. Some of the second-story brackets will
cost from ninety cents to one dollar and a quarter apiece. This
will increase the price of burner margin for the first floor, and
allow more elaborate fixtures.</p>

<p>The mantels are priced to include grate, hearth, facings, and
everything that may go there, excepting fender and blower.
One may get a mantel for $25 or $30, or he may use a grate
setting without a mantel, or may go as far into the hundreds as
his inclination and means will lead him. Very expensive mantels
in moderate-cost houses are not in good taste. A $100 or
$150 mantel in a room all of the other wood-work of which did
not cost over half that sum, is in exceedingly bad form. The
mantel appears like a monument; everything around it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
insignificant. In buying mantels from stock in mantel stores,
the cheaper ones are generally the best designed from an artistic
standpoint.</p>

<p>The furnace price is necessarily arbitrary. The owner of a
house will be told that the price here given is too high and too
low. A moderate-sized, two-story, eight-room house, which,
counting the bath-room, would have nine connections, could be
provided with a furnace of wrought-iron or steel, riveted joints,
double galvanized-iron jacket, for $240. The same furnace brick-set
will cost from fifteen to twenty dollars more. The owner
of such a house can get a cheaper furnace, or he can get one
which will be much more expensive. Oftentimes when an architect
estimates the price of a furnace to the owner, the latter will
respond with the statement that he has been offered a furnace
complete for ninety dollars. Upon investigation it generally
proves that the furnace is in some one&#8217;s store ready for delivery;
that it will cost extra to set it, and for all connections, fittings,
registers, etc.; and that the furnace itself is of such a kind that
ninety dollars is a high price for it. There is no doubt that the
statement as to furnace prices will meet with general disapproval
from manufacturers. Many will say that the prices given are
ridiculously high, and others, ridiculously low. Other general
statements as to heating apparatus may be found in a chapter
given to that subject in that section of the book devoted to the
Journey through the House.</p>

<p>The estimates given on plate and cathedral glass are about
as unsatisfactory as anything can be. They merely give the
owner a general idea as to what to expect.</p>

<p>Electric-work prices are approximately correct for localities
where the facilities for doing this kind of work are at hand.
Door and table bell outfits are now sold and arranged ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
be set up. The methods of their adjustment are so simple that
any one who can read can put them in.</p>

<p>The general statement may be made that these prices are
approximately correct in all the larger markets; and that in
cases where the building is far removed therefrom, there must
necessarily be additions for travel of workmen, and other incidental
expenses in the transportation of material and labor.</p>

<p>The following is the list of prices of material and labor upon
which the building estimates are based:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Excavating, $0.25 a yard.</p>

<p>Brick in the wall, $9 per M.</p>

<p>Mason work, $5.50 a yard, laid up.</p>

<p>Cement floors, $0.70 a square yard.</p>

<p>Timber, joist, and scantling, less than eighteen feet long, $17 per M.</p>

<p>No. 1 common boards, $18 per M.</p>

<p>Select common pine flooring, count measure, $26 per M.</p>

<p>Common flooring, count measure, $22.50 per M.</p>

<p>First quality yellow pine flooring, face measure, $37.50 per M.</p>

<p>Standard yellow pine flooring, face measure, $30 per M.</p>

<p>No. 1 poplar flooring, face measure, $28.50 per M.</p>

<p>No. 2 poplar flooring, face measure, $23.50 per M.</p>

<p>No. 1 stock boards, $20 per M.</p>

<p>No. 1 poplar siding or weather-boarding, $18 per M.</p>

<p>No. 2, $16 per M.</p>

<p>No. 1 pine siding, $22 per M.</p>

<p>No. 2, $20 per M.</p>

<p>Shingles, 16 inches clear butts, best, per M, $3.75.</p>

<p>Shingles, 16 inches extra, 10 inches clear butts, $3.25.</p>

<p>Pine lath, per M, $2.50.</p>

<p>Poplar and pine finishing lumber, $3.75 to $6 per 100 feet.</p>

<p>Oak or maple flooring, first class, $4 to $6 per 100 feet.</p>

<p>Oak finishing lumber, $4 to $6 per 100 feet.</p></blockquote>

<p>Under certain conditions the above prices are subject to
discounts.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>Plastering: three-coat work, plaster-of-Paris finish, $0.25 a yard; two-coat
work, plaster-of-Paris finish, $0.20; gray floated sand finish, three cents
extra on above prices.</p>

<p>Painting, $0.06 per yard a coat.</p>

<p>Labor: common labor, $0.15 an hour; bricklayers and masons, $0.35 to
$0.45 an hour; carpenters, $0.20 to $0.30 an hour; tinners, $0.30 an hour;
painters, $0.20 to $0.30 an hour; plumber and helper, $0.50 an hour.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above labor prices are those paid by the contractors.
Rarely, however, are the maximum prices reached.</p>

<p>There are few subjects on which ideas vary so greatly as
values. This fact may be made apparent when we call to mind
that bids on a house let for $3,000 frequently range $1,000
higher than this figure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>LOW-COST HOUSES.&mdash;METHODS OF MAKING CONTRACTS.&mdash;ARCHITECTS&#8217;
ESTIMATES.&mdash;BUILDING BY THE DAY.&mdash;THE SAFEST PLAN.&mdash;GUARDING
AGAINST LIENS.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>A low-cost, well-built house is sought by all. The cost
of a house is largely a question of business management,&mdash;one
of knowledge. Before considering the details of contracting
for the building of a house, there are a few general
points which should be mentioned. First, it never pays to make
a contract to have a house built for less than it is worth. In
order to get a good house, it is necessary that there be a margin
of profit for the builder. Second, a good house from a constructive
standpoint can only be built by competent mechanics.
One may contract for the building of a house for less than it is
worth with parties who are incapable of doing first-class work,
and require a bond to secure the faithful execution of the contract.
A contract or a bond cannot make a man do good work
if he does not know how to do it. It will not save anxiety
or trouble. It may indemnify against actual damages, but never
against trouble and vexation; nor can it compensate for poor
work done in building a home. This matter is mentioned
because it is the fault of a great many people, who are inexperienced
in building, that they are disposed to have work done
for less than it is worth. It does not pay.</p>

<p>It may be remembered, however, that one builder may be
able to build for less than another. One may have more energy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
tact, or general ability than another. He may have better
credit; may be a better buyer. The result is larger accomplishments.</p>

<p>In speaking of low-cost houses or cheap buildings, it is not
to be understood that they are cheap or low-cost in the sense of
being common or frail. I mean first-class houses at a relatively
low cost; low cost in a business sense, the best for the
money.</p>

<p>We often hear the statement made that one can tell nothing
definite about the cost of a house until it is finished. One can
come as near knowing what a house will cost, as he can to
knowing what he wants before he begins. One can get prices
on what he has in mind, if his ideas be expressed. He cannot
get prices on the unknown. The expression of one&#8217;s ideas
of a house is through plans and specifications. The fact that
architects&#8217; estimates are often too low is because the owner is
not sufficiently informed in house-building to know what he
wants until after the estimate is made. The owner usually
expresses a price that he wishes to pay for his house before he
expresses his idea. It may be well to illustrate this.</p>

<p>One who wishes to build goes to an architect with some
sketches or prints, which he has been collecting, lays them
down and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thinking about building a house. We want something
like this. Here are four rooms and a hall downstairs, and
four rooms and a bath-room above. We want to build of wood,
and wish to have the house warm and substantial. Can it be
built for three thousand dollars? It&#8217;s all we have to put in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; says the architect; and so it can. A good, comfortable,
substantial house, from the plans indicated, can be
built for three thousand dollars. The architect knows this, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
says that the work can be done for that price. He is
ordered to make the plans. In a day or two the owner comes
into his office and says,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife and I were talking over the house last night, and
concluded that we would like to have a bay window from the
dining-room,&mdash;a place where we can sit in summer, and put
flowers in the winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she told me to ask where you were going to put a
wash-stand downstairs. You know we will want some kind of
a wash-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought anything about that,&#8221; said the architect.
&#8220;Nothing was said about it. I supposed that in a house of this
size the bath-room was the only place where you would put a
stationary wash-stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to have a place downstairs. We can&#8217;t go upstairs
every time we want to wash our hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another two or three days pass. The owner visits the
architect again. It is the old story. He and his wife have
been studying the house question in earnest. They are educating
themselves in house-building. The more they think
about it, the more they want, all of which is perfectly natural
and right. It is in the natural order of things. It is the way
the world moves.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were talking about the house, and have about concluded
that we will finish two front rooms upstairs in oak.
What do you think it will cost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you use oak for all the wood-work, it will cost between
forty and fifty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t much. We&#8217;ll have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the house grows as the owners grow, a little every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
day. The next day it is a little more plate glass at a cost of
fifteen dollars. Again, it is bronze hardware at an extra cost
of twenty dollars. Then it is bevelled-glass doors in the china-closet,
plastering in the attic, a tile vestibule, a porch off from
the dining-room, and so on.</p>

<p>The three thousand dollars is exceeded, though probably by
something less than the amount represented by the growth of
the owner&#8217;s ideas. The architect had made a certain allowance
for this development, though it was not possible for him entirely
to foresee it. Of those who build, the ones who take the greatest
interest in the house, those who think the most about it, are
usually the ones who exceed their original calculations by the
largest amount.</p>

<p>In building, it is important that the architect and the owner
thoroughly understand each other before contracts with the
builders are signed. The wants of the owner must be thoroughly
understood, and carefully and accurately set forth. From
the plans and specifications estimates for all parts of the work
should be received, and the cost of everything known, before
obligations are created. The process of making the plans and
specifications, and taking the bids, is educational in its tendency.
It brings to the owner&#8217;s attention nearly everything that he
may want. Frequently he will find that the first estimates
which he gets are higher than the amount he cared to expend.
This is on account of his growth. He can frequently reduce
the cost without positive injury to the original scheme.</p>

<p>We will consider how contracts are usually made. Sometimes
it is by making plans and specifications for the entire
house, and then asking for bids on the building as a whole. A
general contractor makes his figures on the various parts of the
work, then adds them together and makes a lump bid. If he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
awarded the contract under such a system, he does part of the
work himself and sublets the rest. Possibly he may be a carpenter;
then he sublets the brick work, plastering, tinning,
painting, etc., and, if possible, he makes a profit on all of these
sub-contracts. It does not always happen that he makes figures
on these various divisions of the contract himself when forming
his original bid. He gets sub-bids from various mechanics and
adds these to his own in making up a lump bid. It is known
that there is a very wide range of difference between bids which
come in this way. In a house to cost three thousand dollars
the bids not infrequently vary twenty-five to thirty per cent.
The highest bid may be over four thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Another way of contracting is for the architect or owner, as
the case may be, to take bids on the various details of excavating,
stone work, brick work, carpenter work, painting, plastering,
galvanized iron and tin, glass, plumbing, gas-fitting, etc.;
in fact, to detail the work as much as possible and receive
detailed bids. If the work costs too much, if the bids run too
high, one can locate the excess.</p>

<p>At times one can get a cheaper house by pursuing this plan.
Another plan of building is by the day. Usually this means to
employ carpenters and a foreman, take bids on the material that
the carpenters use, and to sublet the mason work, excavating,
painting, plastering, tin-work, plumbing, etc. Sometimes the
mason-work is also done by the day.</p>

<p>Each plan has its merits. The first mentioned, of letting
most of the work in one contract, is the one in most general use.
It is common practice in this connection to let excavating,
mason work, carpenter work, plastering, tinning, painting, and
hardware in one general contract; then the mantels, gas-fixtures,
furnace, plumbing, electric work, and ornamental glass work are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
let in separate contracts. It is difficult for one to specify gas-fixtures,
mantels, and similar fittings, excepting by price. There
is no satisfaction in this, for the reason that the owner or his
architect may be able to make quite as good or even a better
bargain than the contractor. Then there is no opportunity for
the builder to arrange for a relatively high price with those who
furnish this class of goods. It is fair for the builder to assume
that he is entitled to a certain percentage for selecting and
negotiating for such articles. The owner may save this for
himself by making his own purchases.</p>

<p>Plumbing work is frequently separated from the general
contract in order that the owner may exercise his discretion as
to the workmen employed to do this important work. In such
circumstances it is not altogether a matter of cost. It is of the
utmost importance that the best of workmen be employed.</p>

<p>The articles which cannot be directly specified should be
secured outside the general contract. Altogether, the plan of
letting most of the work in one contract, as outlined, is the best
and safest for those to pursue who are not thoroughly familiar
with building operations.</p>

<p>The plan of subletting the separate contracts to the lowest
bidders is not to be recommended to those without large experience.
The difficulty in locating responsibility for delays is great.
There is apt to be contention, annoyance, and sometimes loss,
by this confusion. The plan of building by the day is more
satisfactory for experienced builders than the one just mentioned,
but it has the disadvantage of not fully representing to
the owner before it is finished the cost of his structure.</p>

<p>In nearly every city or town there are a number of good
builders, not well supplied with means, who will take a contract
for building a house, work on it themselves until it is finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and then take another, never having more than one or two
houses on hand. One can frequently get good work from such
builders at a much less cost than from large contractors. The
larger contractors employ a foreman at about the same price a
day that the small contractors expect to get per day out of their
entire contract. Then, in addition to that, they receive their
profits of ten, fifteen, or other per cent for their time and attention.
Any one building with the help of the smaller contractors
must be very careful, or he will get into trouble on account of
the small margin of profit.</p>

<p>To recur to the method first mentioned. It is well that suggestions
be made as to the course to be pursued in receiving
bids on work, as classified in that suggestion. In the first place,
there should be accurate plans and specifications made by an
architect capable of doing that kind of work. Everything should
be fully represented to the owner in both a positive and negative
way; that is, not only as to what is to go into his house,
but as to what is not to go into it. As soon as the architect or
those in charge of the work begin to take bids, the owner should
be provided with a complete copy of the plans and specifications,
in order that he may be fully conversant with what is to be done.
It was said that everything should be represented to the owner
in both a positive and negative way. Not only should it be
stated to him that the first floor of the house is to be plastered,
but, if such is the case, that the cellar is not to be plastered. If
the cellar floor is not to be cemented, it should be stated definitely
to him in that way before beginning to take bids. If fly-screens
are not included in the building contract, it should be so
stated. Everything should be fully represented, and a record
thereof placed before the owner, so that there can be not the
slightest opportunity for misunderstanding or disagreement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Thus, if everything is presented to the owner, he will know what
he is to have and what he is not to have, and his business will
be done for him in a way satisfactory to all. When this is done,
it is time to begin taking bids.</p>

<p>In doing this there should be no favoritism. The builder
should be allowed to take a copy of the plans and specifications
with him to his office or place of business, and keep them a
day or more, in order to take off his quantities and become
thoroughly conversant with everything connected with them.
Then he can return the plans, and, while others are doing the
same thing, he can compile his figures. Generally it takes about
a day for each contractor to get through with a set of plans;
that is, if five bids are received, it generally takes five or six
days, assuming that only one set of plans is in use. No one
should be asked to figure on a building unless the owner is
willing to award him the contract, providing his bid is the lowest.
Anything else is unfair. When all the bids have been received
in sealed envelopes, the architect and owner may open them.
After selecting the lowest, they may add to that figure the cost
of everything not included in that proposition,&mdash;the furnace,
mantels, gas fixtures, ornamental glass, and anything else that
has not been included in the bid. This may be readily done,
if the architect provide a schedule, similar to schedule &#8220;B,&#8221; of
everything which may go into the house.</p>

<p>In the matter of closing the contract, only general statements
can be made. Where an architect is employed, he will give
proper directions; but, as many houses are built without such
assistance, it is proper to make general statements which will
assist in this work. There are forms of building-contracts, or
articles of agreement, which may be secured from various regular
sources. It is proper to fix the time of the completion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the work, which will vary in different parts of the country
according to general customs. A house to cost from fifteen
hundred to four thousand dollars may be very easily finished,
under favorable circumstances, in ninety to a hundred days.
Such houses can be built in less time, but it is best to give the
builder at least three months. He will do better work in that
time than in less. For the higher figure named, or for those
which approach it, it may be better to allow even a little more
rather than less time. As a price for liquidated damages in
event of delay in completion, the rental value of the property
is the usual sum specified.</p>

<p>There are various plans pursued in the matter of payments.
Where there is an architect or superintendent, he usually issues
orders on the owner for payment of material and labor furnished
by a contractor less ten or fifteen per cent. Sometimes it is
stated that two-fifths of the money will be paid when the building
is enclosed and under roof; one-fifth additional when building
is plastered, painted on exterior, all exterior appurtenances
finished, the floors laid, and the house ready for other interior
wood-work; and the remaining two-fifths when all work is finished.
At times this apportionment is correct, and at other times
not. However, it is a very good general rule. It is a good plan
to add the ten per cent discount to it when possible. Sometimes
an indemnifying bond is required of the contractor in order to
secure the owner the proper execution of the contract. Otherwise
the ten or fifteen per cent discount is relied upon to secure
that end.</p>

<p>The lien laws in the various States make it very important
that the owner, or his agent in the matter of building, should be
very careful to see that the contractor pays all his bills, or
secures releases from those who have furnished material and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
labor on account of the building contract, before money is paid
by owner.</p>

<p>The law is different in various States, and renders the owner
liable, under varying conditions, for material and labor furnished
to contractor by others as employees or sub-contractor, even
though payment has been made by owner to general contractor.
Where a bond is not required, it is proper for the owner or his
agent to exact releases in proper form from those who have
furnished material and labor to contractor. The following form
is in use by the writer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Work located</p>

<p>The undersigned, in consideration of the personal credit extended by&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, Contractor, hereby consent that
may pay to said contractor any sum that may be now owing to, or may hereafter
become due, said contractor, on account of contract for the construction
of the above works, and we hereby waive all rights to Mechanics&#8217; Liens or
other claims which we have, or may have, against said property, or owner, on
account of labor or material furnished by us.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 3em;"><span class="smcap">Indianapolis</span>,<span style="margin-left: 3em;">1889.</span></span></p></blockquote>

<p>It is the custom to furnish the builder with a number of
copies of the above release before it is time for him to secure
an order on the owner for money. As the architect is in a position
to know from whom material or labor is secured, it is possible
for him to know if the list of releases is complete. If not
complete, the party refusing to give a release is required to make
statement as to the amount of the indebtedness for material and
labor furnished on the contract. The general contractor is
charged with the amount represented as being due until the
matter is fully adjusted. As an additional safeguard, the contractor
is at times required to fill out and make affidavit to the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p class="right"><span class="smcap">Indianapolis</span>,<span style="margin-left: 3em;">1889.</span></p>

<p>The undersigned, for the purpose of securing payment on account of
contract with &mdash;&mdash;, for the construction of a &mdash;&mdash; house, known
as No. &mdash;&mdash; on &mdash;&mdash; Street, situated on Lot &mdash;&mdash;, Out-lot &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;
Division to City of Indianapolis, Marion County, State of Indiana, represents
hereby that he has paid for all labor and material of every kind and nature
had and procured therefor, excepting, however, that he is now owing the following
sums to the respective parties hereinafter named for labor and materials
for said building, and owes therefor no other amounts, to wit:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>In this connection it is not possible to consider all of the
ramifications of the lien law. It is important to understand,
however, that it is entirely possible for an owner to have to pay
for part of or all of his house twice, if he is not careful in matters
of this kind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>MONTHLY PAYMENTS.&mdash;CALCULATIONS ON A LONG-TIME PLAN.&mdash;PURCHASE
ON A RENTAL BASIS.&mdash;HOW IT MAY BE WORKED OUT.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>It is a pleasant thought that every one can own a home of his
own. With only a moderate salary, and little or nothing
ahead, a thought of this kind may appear more pleasant than
real. It may be affirmed, however, that, with few exceptions,
any one who can pay rent may own his home. This will require
certain sacrifices and at first great economy, but in the end the
result justifies the means. There is no reason why any one
should pay rent. Building associations are instrumental in
securing more homes for people on a long-time plan than any
other scheme. In the large towns, however, houses are sold
on various kinds of instalment plans. By way of illustration,
the writer calls to mind a five-room house, pleasantly situated,
which was built about three years ago. This house is being
paid for in instalments of $15 a month. An arrangement of
this kind is good for all concerned. It is an easy way for one
to get a home. It is a good use of money, from a business
standpoint, for the one who has the money to invest. A little
demonstration will make this plain. The lot on which the
house was situated was valued at $400. The house, with
walks, well, cistern, and outbuildings, cost $900. Here is a
total investment of $1,300. The purchaser paid $300 in cash.
There remained $1,000 unpaid. The interest on $1,000 for
a year at six per cent is $60; but as the volume of interest is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
reduced as the payments are made, the actual interest for
the full period averages about one-half of $60, or $30, per
year. To make this point clear, I will state it in another
way. The principal is being reduced as the monthly payments
are made. As the payments advance, the amount of interest
necessarily decreases, as there is not so much principal on
which to pay interest. As a matter of fact, one pays six per
cent interest on just one-half of $1,000 for the full period, or,
what amounts to the same thing, the average interest on the
full period is three per cent. Thus, one is paying an average
interest of $30 per year; and, as he pays $15 a month, this
would be $180 a year for principal and interest, $150 of which
would apply to the principal. Thus it is that in six years and
eight months the one paying $15 a month will own the house
and lot. I know of other cases where less each month is paid
and a longer time is taken. It would take $10.83<a href="#TN_1">[1]</a> per month
to pay for a house of this kind in ten years, with a cash payment
of $300.</p>

<p>It may be said that nobody but a philanthropist would sell
property in this way. In the case of which I speak, the philanthropist
is the manager of the property of a life-insurance company
which owns quite a large amount of unimproved real
estate in a Western city, and had a surplus capital on which it
desired to realize. It is a good thing for the company. By
this means it is enabled to dispose of its real estate, and
to use its money profitably.</p>

<p>This is not strictly architectural, but it may result in showing
some one how to get a home, or others how to make use of idle
capital in a safe and profitable way. It is better for one who has
money to invest to sell houses in this way than it is to rent them.
He gets profit on the sale, and interest on his money, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
latter is all he expects under other circumstances, and disposes
of the houses before they need repairs. This is the view which
the capitalist takes of the situation. By looking into it a little
further, he may see that he will not be troubled by insurance, a
vacant house, or repairs. The cash payment is sufficient to
protect the expense of foreclosing the mortgage and the rental
of the house during the time of the redemption. In some instances
the property is leased on the payment of a small cash
bonus, with the stipulation that when one-third, one-fourth, or
other agreed portion of selling price is paid in, that a deed will
be given; further payment being secured by mortgage.</p>

<p>Building associations are not common in all sections of the
country. Those who are ambitious to build, and are not provided
with facilities which a building association offers, may ask
what to do. The answer is short: form an association. This
can be done in a small community. Two hundred shares paid
in, say, by fifty people, would represent a hundred dollars a
week. Any one who wishes to do this can provide himself with
text-books and other information on the subject, which are now
published in different parts of the country. Any bookseller with
a good catalogue can give the necessary information.</p>

<p>It is sometimes assumed by those unfamiliar with building-association
methods, that they only provide means for building
small, low-cost houses. This is an error. It is not at all unusual
that complete houses, costing from three to five thousand
dollars, are built by men of large means, who secure their
money from a building association. One has, say, forty or fifty
thousand dollars profitably occupied in a regular business; he
may not care to disturb this money except to buy a lot with which
to establish a basis of credit with the building association. The
price of the lot may vary from one-fourth to one-half the total<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
investment. One wishes to borrow three thousand dollars
from an association on the plan which is subsequently fully
described. He would have to take out fifteen shares on a payment
of fifty cents a share a week. This would represent seven
dollars and a half weekly, or about thirty dollars a month. On
the plan where the interest and premium are charged in addition
to the regular weekly dues, a little over fifty dollars a month
would be required to keep up the building-association charges.
This would be less than house rent. These calculations are
made assuming that the premium is not more than ten cents
and the interest six per cent.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>BUILDING ASSOCIATIONS.&mdash;WHY DIVIDENDS ARE LARGE AND INTEREST
LOW.&mdash;BUILDING ASSOCIATIONS AND SAVINGS BANKS.&mdash;ASSOCIATION
SECURITIES.&mdash;BUILDING-ASSOCIATION METHODS.&mdash;DIFFERENT
PLANS.&mdash;BORROWING FROM A BUILDING ASSOCIATION.&mdash;A
BUILDING-ASSOCIATION REPORT.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>Building-association methods become more popular
as they are better understood. Savings banks are unnecessary
in communities where building associations are common.
The savings bank will give place to the building association, for
the reason that the latter affords greater security and more profit
to the depositors at the same time that it affords greater conveniences
to the borrowers. It is often asked by those not fully
acquainted with building-association methods, &#8220;How is it that
the association pays such large dividends, and the borrower such
a small rate of interest? The profit is made by the loaning
of money; and, consequently, the borrower must pay a high
price for his money, or the association does not make large
dividends.&#8221;</p>

<p>This appears to be a logical argument. However, it is not
true that the borrower pays a high price for his money. The
dividends declared are made from the borrowers, by the rapid
compounding of interest and other sources of profit. Money
paid in as interest is immediately re-invested as a loan, and
thus pays interest the next week. The interest on this is at
once put to use, and so on. It is compounded. The premium
paid for money is another source of profit. This comes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
the borrower, and represents a part of the cost of the money
to him; but, unless the premium is excessive, the earnings
on his stock counterbalance the amount paid as premium, so
that in the end a borrower does not pay in excess of the regular
rate for his money at the same time that the stockholder is
more largely benefited.</p>

<p>A building association has only a tithe of the expenses of a
bank. The cost of doing business is very small. An association
has a very great advantage over a bank in its earning capacity
in that it does not have to carry a surplus. All of its money is
invested at all times. Frequently it is receiving interest upon
money that is not a part of its assets. This happens when an
application for a loan has been accepted, a building is under
way, and the money not all paid out.</p>

<p>The percentage of loss in a building association is necessarily
smaller than in the best-conducted bank. Its securities are all
first mortgages on productive real estate, and loans are made
to members only, and under the condition that the immediate
repayment of the loan be commenced. The security begins to
improve at once, by the repayment of a part of the principal
each week. It is usual for each member of a family to
become interested in the immediate repayment of a loan.
The payment of building-association dues is constantly in mind;
as they become due from week to week, they cannot be overlooked.
The fact that the debt is growing less, and, as well,
the incentive to avoid small fines in case of failure to make payment,
contribute to the value of the security. A loan on an
ordinary basis, secured from a savings bank, insurance or trust
company for a long period, is not thought of in this way. The
usual thought in such a case is to pay the debt in a large sum
at a time in the future. The time of the repayment of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
association loan is always present. The security afforded to
building associations is much better than to savings banks and
loan companies, even where the margin above the amount of
loan is less because of this difference in plan of repayment.
Again, the margin of security from the first is always sufficient
to protect a mortgage and the payment of all foreclosure costs
and charges. Furthermore, the rentals in case of foreclosure
are, or should be, sufficient to pay all dues and other fixed
charges. This will prevent loss, and in the end pay for the
property.</p>

<p>Another element of safety in building associations is the small
risk of loss from the duplicity of the officers. This risk is unusually
light, for the reason that in a well-managed building
association there is little in sight to lose. The money is usually
all invested. Any small amount in the hands of the officers is
there for only a short time. There are demands in all well-managed
building associations for all the money in hand. While
this is true, it is always required that the officers who handle the
association money give bond for a much larger sum than it is
possible for them ever to have in charge. This makes the loss,
if any, readily collectible.</p>

<p>It may be well to illustrate building-association methods,
and thus call attention intelligently to the points of superiority
which one plan may have over another.</p>

<p>The idea which first gave rise to associations is that of
enabling persons belonging to a class whose earnings are small,
to place themselves in a position where the process of gradual
accumulation is, in a certain sense, compulsory. The method of
operation is simple enough when it is understood. Say that
a number of stockholders agree to form an association with a
thousand shares, each share to represent $200. This would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
make a full capital stock of $200,000 when all paid in. The
various individuals forming the association subscribe for as
many shares as they feel competent to pay upon, it being agreed
that for each share of stock subscribed, fifty cents per week shall
be paid until the sum-total of the payments shall aggregate
$200; at the end of which time a division shall be made according
to the original subscription and subsequent payment. It is
clear that if all are prompt in their payments, the treasury will
be ready for distribution at the end of four hundred weeks.
The period of four hundred weeks will, however, be shortened
if all the money paid in is at once invested at interest upon safe
securities, with the addition of interests compounded weekly, as
is the case with these associations. For instance, it may appear
that at the end of three hundred and twelve weeks, with a payment
of fifty cents a week, and the accrued earnings that are
credited to the shares, they are worth $200, the amount fixed for
the value of the stock when it is paid up. At such a time the
depositing members withdraw their funds, and those who are
borrowers pay off their obligations to the association with stock,
and the mortgages are released.</p>

<p>Money in building associations is generally sold to the highest
bidder; that is, those who want to borrow bid a premium for
the money. For instance, a sale of money is advertised. Bids
are then received on the money to be loaned, and it is given
to the highest bidder after the security has been approved.
Suppose one wishes to borrow a thousand dollars. If each paid-up
share is to represent two hundred dollars, five shares must
be taken out to represent the payment of principal on a thousand-dollar
loan. It may appear that the premium bid was ten
cents on each share. This means that the borrower must pay
ten cents premium each week, on each share, during the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
of the loan, or until the principal is paid out. Thus he would
pay fifty cents a week as principal, and ten cents a week as
premium, and the interest on two hundred dollars at six per
cent, which would be twenty-four cents a week. Thus he
would pay eighty-four cents a week on each share; or on five
shares, four dollars and twenty cents a week. This would pay
out in about five years, depending upon the average rate of
premium, the cost of doing business, and other conditions which
may be readily understood. When the principal paid in, together
with the accrued earnings, represents two hundred dollars, the
obligation to the building association is released.</p>

<p>There are various plans of starting and arranging building
and savings associations, which differ one from another only in
matters of detail. The price of the share may be two, three, or
four hundred dollars, or any other sum. The amounts paid
in a week vary from ten cents to any larger sum. In the past,
most associations have been started on the series plan, which is
defined as follows by Henry S. Rosenthal of Cincinnati in his
&#8220;Manual for Building Associations:&#8221;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In an association, organized on the terminating plan, all the stock is
issued as of one date. A terminating association is organized on the presumption
that all the stock will be subscribed for at the open meetings. This,
however, is seldom done. The consequence is, that shares sold after the first
meetings must be sold at such prices as to make them equal in value to those
already issued. To do this a sum must be charged equal to the amount already
paid in in instalments by the subscribers to the original shares. If the regular
dues on shares should be one dollar per week, a person subscribing for a
share after the association has been running ten weeks must pay ten dollars
for the share. In like manner, if the association has been running for a
longer period, he must pay an additional dollar for each additional week.
Moreover, if he does not subscribe until after the profits have been declared,
he must pay such an additional amount on his share as will correspond to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>earnings of the original shares up to that time. The same rule holds through
the entire existence of the association, each year making it more difficult to
enter. After an association, organized on this plan, has run for a time, it is
impossible for many persons, who would gladly become members, to raise a
sufficient sum of money to pay up the back instalments, the initiation fees, the
accrued profits, and other incidental expenses. In its practical workings,
therefore, an association organized on this plan is not well adapted to meet
the conditions of that particular class of persons who most need such an organization,
and are most likely to be benefited by it.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a terminating association all the shares are, of course, at all times of
equal value. Whenever the total amounts of the dues paid in and of accumulated
profits equal the par value of all the shares, the association terminates
and its affairs must be wound up. Each stockholder who has not borrowed his
money in advance receives the full value of his shares. To those who have
secured their money in advance, their mortgages, cancelled and receipted in
full, are returned.</p>

<p class="title">&#8220;PERMANENT ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p>&#8220;Building associations were established originally on the terminating
plan. It is obvious that working on this plan they cannot, in some respects,
reach their greatest degree of popularity and usefulness. On this account
there has been a gradual departure from this plan. The first departure from
the terminating plan consisted in an arrangement for issuing the stock in
series instead of all from the same date. Associations were chartered for a
certain number of years, as before, and with a specified amount of capital
stock. But instead of selling all the stock as of the same date, it was divided
into series; one series being sold as of the date of the beginning of the first
year, the second series as of the date of the beginning of the second year, and
so on until all the shares were sold. The issuing of a new series does not
necessarily occur annually, but at such periods as are made necessary or
desirable by the business of the association. The serial issue may be monthly,
quarterly, semi-annually, or otherwise, as the directors may determine. By
the time the last series is issued and the stock is exhausted, the first one or
two or more series of shares, if the business of the association has been prosperous,
have usually reached their full value, and are paid back and cancelled.
Associations conducted on this plan usually have the right to issue new stock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>to take the place of that which is cancelled from time to time, and thus their
perpetuity is insured. A successful association working on this plan can
usually secure the issue of a new charter, and can thus continue its existence.
But there are manifest disadvantages and risks under which an association
operating on this plan must labor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another plan of operation has been inaugurated which has proved very
popular, and which is being generally adopted by the associations in the
different States. Associations are granted perpetual charters, the amount of
the capital stock being fixed at a certain sum. They are allowed to begin
operations as soon as a certain amount of stock is subscribed. After the association
is in operation, new subscribers are allowed to enter at any time on
an equality with the original subscribers, the stock of each member dating
from the time of his entry. Thus the business of the association runs along
from year to year, until finally all of the stock is subscribed. After a time the
shares first issued begin to reach their full value. As they thus mature, the
owners draw out their money,&mdash;if they have not borrowed it in advance,&mdash;and
their shares are cancelled, and their membership ceases. If they have
borrowed their money in advance, their bonds and mortgages are returned to
them receipted in full. If a member, whose stock has thus matured, has not
borrowed his money in advance, and does not wish to draw it out, a certificate
of paid-up stock is issued to him, and he leaves his money in the association
as a matter of investment. An association operating on this plan may, after
a time, when its original stock has all been subscribed through application to
the incorporating authorities, secure the right to increase its stock. If, in the
course of time, this increased stock becomes exhausted, another increase may
be secured in a like manner, and so on indefinitely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Herewith is given an extract from the yearly report of a
successful savings and loan association on the perpetual plan.
It will illustrate more fully the method and results of this method
than could a less formal description. It may be explained in
this connection that in this society the payments are uniform for
depositing and borrowing members; that is, instead of having
the premium and interest added to the weekly dues, the amount
of premium and interest is charged against the weekly payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
of fifty cents. Ten cents is the limit of premium, the officers
and stockholders believing that to be as much as any one should
pay.</p>

<p class="title">OBJECT.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">The Plymouth Savings and Loan Association, No. 2</span>, is organized
with two main objects in view:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First.</span>&mdash;To furnish a convenient, safe, and profitable method of investing
the savings of working people.</p>

<p>Members can come in and go out at will.</p>

<p>Subscriptions can commence at any time without having to pay back dues
or wait for new series.</p>

<p>Withdrawing members obtain their money without loss (fines excepted),
and are paid as promptly as the finances of the Association will admit, without
having to wait ninety days. In the history of the Association there have
been no delays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second.</span>&mdash;To furnish persons who wish to borrow for any purpose the
means for doing so at a reasonable rate of interest. In other words, it is an
association composed of borrowers and lenders, and established for their
mutual convenience. It gathers together the savings of the people, which,
scattered and in small sums, could not be invested to advantage, and loans
the money thus obtained on first mortgage security, and in sums to suit, to
those who wish to build, to pay off mortgages, or for other purposes.</p>

<p>All members of the Association are, therefore, divided into two classes:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;Those who desire to use the society as a means of saving or
investing money. These are called <i>depositing members</i>.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;Those who wish to make use of the organization as a means of
borrowing money. These are called <i>borrowing members</i>.</p>

<p class="title">MANAGEMENT.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Plymouth Savings and Loan Association</span> is a strictly co-operative
or mutual organization. All the shareholders are <i>pro rata</i> owners of all
the assets of the society. Every member is a partner in the enterprise in proportion
to the amount paid in by him. He is entitled to his share of all the
earnings of the Association, and he must also stand his share of the losses, if
there be any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>The By-laws contain the rules and regulations under which money is
received and loaned, or otherwise disposed of, and the business of the society
is carried on by a Board of Directors, elected annually by the members.</p>

<p class="title">SHARES AND SHAREHOLDERS.</p>

<p>The amount of interest which each member has in the Association is
indicated by the number of his shares.</p>

<p>Shares are $200 each, and no member can hold more than twenty-five
shares. The weekly payment required is fifty cents on each share of stock.</p>

<p>When a member joins the Association he indicates the amount of weekly
payment he desires to make by the number of shares for which he subscribes.
He may, however, if he wishes, pay more than his shares call for, and such
over-payments will receive dividends the same as the regular weekly instalments.</p>

<p>Each member is supposed to keep up his payments until what he has paid
in, together with the dividends declared thereon, shall amount to the face
value of his shares, at which time he must cease payments, and either take
his money out, or, if the society be willing, allow it to remain and draw
dividends.</p>

<p class="title">DIVIDENDS.</p>

<p>On the 1st of January and July of each year the net earnings of the Association
are divided <i>pro rata</i> among all the members, and the amount due each
member is credited on his pass-book.</p>

<p>Persons joining the association between January and July must continue
payments until the following January before the dividend will be credited, and
those joining between July and January must likewise pay until the following
July; and if the money be withdrawn before that time, the dividend will be
forfeited.</p>

<p>The right to dividend also ceases from the date of the notice to withdraw
the stock.</p>

<p>When dividends are credited on the pass-books they are just like money
paid, and are themselves entitled to draw dividends the same as cash payments.
Thus it will be seen that all dividends compound semi-annually.</p>

<p class="title">METHOD OF LOANING MONEY.</p>
<p>The society loans money only to members. For each $200 share held by
a member he may borrow $200, secured by first mortgage on real estate,
interest on which is twenty-four cents per week.</p>

<p>The right to precedence in borrowing is sold at auction at stated times
at the office of the Association (notice of which is given beforehand) to the
member who bids or agrees to pay the highest weekly premium in addition to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>the twenty-four cents per week interest. Ten cents per week is the average
rate at which money was sold during the year 1887, and is now selling.</p>

<p>Members not desiring or not able to attend the sale of money in person
may have some one else bid for them, or they may leave a written bid with
the Secretary, on blanks prepared for that purpose, who will make it for them
at the sale.</p>

<p>The society also loans to depositing members in sums equal to ninety
per cent of the dues paid in. Security is had by the member pledging his
stock for the payment of the loan and interest due (if any) on notes prepared
for that purpose. Interest on such loans has for the present been placed at
the rate of eight per cent per annum.</p>

<p class="title">PAYMENTS.</p>

<p>The depositing and borrowing members alike pay fifty cents per week per
share. There are no additions for expenses, interest, premiums, or fines.
These are charged up at the close of each dividend period, or at the closing
up of an account.</p>

<p>Each borrower is required to pay at least fifty cents per week on each
$200 of loan made to him, which is credited as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>First the premium and interest are taken out, the interest being twenty-four
cents. When the premium bid is ten cents, both together would amount
to thirty-four cents. Then the balance, which in this case would be sixteen
cents, is credited as a payment on the share on which the loan is taken.
These payments are continued until the amount credited on the shares, together
with the dividends thereon, will equal the amount loaned. For instance,
suppose the loan to be $200, and the premium bid to be ten cents per week,&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tdl">The credit on the share each week would be</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td class="tdr">16 cents</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>These credits of sixteen cents per week begin to draw dividends on the
succeeding dividend period, which are compounded semi-annually, and the
weekly payments must be continued until the weekly credits of sixteen cents
and the dividends thereon amount to $200.</p>

<p>Members are at liberty to pay every two weeks or monthly, and as much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>beyond the required weekly payment as they may desire to. The overpayments
are credited like any regular payment and share in the dividends.</p>

<p>This enables borrowers to pay their loans off as fast as their circumstances
will admit. This method is very helpful, as the interest and premium
will be stopped on as many full shares as are paid off, and the cost of a loan
is materially reduced thereby.</p>

<p>The minimum payment only is fixed. The borrower may at any time pay
the whole balance due on the loan and have it cancelled at once.</p>

<p>It is always good policy for a borrower to pay more than the weekly dues
if he can, in order that in case of sickness, loss of work, or other unforeseen
hindrance, he may be paid ahead, and hence suspend payment for a time
without being fined or in danger of losing his property.</p>

<p>By the following table it is shown that with the premium at twenty-four
cents on each $200, and that the society is able to earn six per cent per
annum dividends (both of which are being done now<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>), and the required
weekly dues only being paid, a loan will be paid up in fifteen years and six
months. This time, as already mentioned, can be shortened at the will and
ability of the borrower, and may be paid off at any time without any penalty
whatever. This is a great advantage, and the society can do this only because
of the great demand for loans, and the money does not have to lie idle if a
loan is paid off, but is immediately loaned again. Here is a loan which you
may take fifteen years to pay if you wish, or you may pay it off at any time.</p>

<p>With the reasonable prospect in view that the Association will be able to
pay larger dividends at some future time, it will be easy to understand that
the cost and the time of payment of a loan will thereby be correspondingly

<p class="title">MORTGAGES.</p>

<p>All loans must be secured by first mortgage on real estate in Marion
County, Ind. An appraising committee, consisting of three members of the
Association, appraise the value of all real estate offered as security for loans
and report to the board. No loan can be made until the security has been
approved by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>This Association is now paying four per cent semi-annual dividends, and
adding largely to its surplus.</p></blockquote>

<p>A new feature in building-association work has recently been
put into practice. The association will buy for cash a house
and lot, or buy a lot and build a house thereon, and sell at a fair
price to the member whose application is accepted. Where the
house and lot are bought at a cash price, it is usual to charge a
ten per cent bonus when selling it on time to a member. The
purchaser then completes the transaction by securing the purchase
money to the association, the same as in case of a loan
on any other property, except that instead of a deed from the
association he will receive a lease, with an agreement to sell and
convey to him the premises as soon as one-third of the purchase
money shall have been paid in regular dues on his stock.
His stock will be assigned as collateral security, and the
payments will be credited as rent until the deed is made.
Then the purchaser will execute his mortgage for the unpaid
balance due on the property on the terms of his original
bid for the money. It is usual to require a cash payment equal
to the amount of the bonus; that is, ten per cent of the purchase
price. This is a valuable feature in building-association
methods. It adds to the profits of the association. This
plan is adaptable to private enterprise, and is liberal in its
terms to the purchaser.</p>

<p>In most associations organized on the perpetual plan, as previously
described, the demand for funds is greater than can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
supplied from depositing members. This has given rise to the
&#8220;paid-up stock&#8221; feature of building associations. Under this
plan one may invest money in any sum according to the terms
of the charter and secure from the association a certificate of
paid-up stock which participates in the regular dividends of the
company. In this way, funds in larger amounts may be secured
than come from the ordinary payments by regular weekly dues.
It is not unusual for individuals to purchase paid-up stock to
the amount of several thousand dollars. This is a great help
to an association which is short of funds, as it serves to increase
its membership by addition of borrowers. There is no better
place to invest trust funds than in the paid-up stock of well-managed
building associations. Primarily, for the reason that
each stockholder is pledged in the amount of his stock to pay
principal and six per cent interest on all withdrawals; hence, the
funds may be withdrawn at any time, and six per cent interest
thereon demanded. Furthermore, building-association stock is
not taxable in most States.</p>

<p>Individual and moneyed corporations are coming to consider
the matter of loans, and means leading to their repayment, on
the building-association plan. This will be brought about largely
by the low price of money throughout the country at this time.
Savings banks, mortgage companies, and life-insurance organizations
are finding it difficult to loan their funds at a price that will
pay their fixed obligations; hence, they are seeking means which
will lead to a more profitable investment of their funds. The
building-association plan of loaning money is one solution of
the problem. The low price of money is one of the elements
which within the next few years will enable nearly every one
who so desires to secure a home through the building association,
or some plan which has its outgrowth therefrom.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XL.</h3>

<blockquote><p><small>PURCHASE OF A LOT.&mdash;THE BEST THE CHEAPEST.&mdash;A GOOD LOT AS
A BASIS OF SECURITY.&mdash;THE BASIS OF VALUE IS THE RENTAL.</small></p></blockquote>

<p>There are many things to consider in connection with the
building of a house other than those which are constructive.
One may lay aside that which has to do with appearances,
convenience, stability, and all that is architectural, and yet have
food for thought in connection with the making of a home. For
instance, the lot. No one can afford to build on one that is
absolutely cheap, or one that is cheap because it is not well
located or favorably thought of by the large number of people.
A lot that is absolutely cheap is not often worth even what is
paid for it. One of small means can least of all afford to put
his money in a questionable piece of property. A lot may be
relatively cheap, and be a good investment. For instance, there
is a street lined with comfortable houses. On this street live
people of more or less wealth and unquestioned ambition.
Three or four squares beyond the last house of this street the
lots may be relatively cheap. The sum asked for them is not
great, for the reason that few care to go out so far. Still, by
adopting a little of the pioneer spirit, one can make a purchase
of these lots and be reasonably certain of being rewarded
for his foresight. It is much better to buy such a lot, and live
for a year or two without immediate neighbors, than to buy one
which is absolutely cheap because the surroundings are positively
unfavorable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>A man of small means least of all can afford to buy a lot
that cannot readily be sold for all it cost. We often hear people
say, in regard to lots that are surrounded unfavorably, &#8220;What is
the difference? It suits us; we can be as happy and comfortable
there as any place. If we like it, why should any one else
complain?&#8221; No one else will complain. It may occur that the
owner of this absolutely cheap property may wish to sell. He
may become embarrassed in his business, or one of many things
may happen to cripple him financially. If he can sell at all, it
is at a sacrifice. If a mortgage is foreclosed, there is no reasonable
chance of redemption. If the lot is well located, and he
becomes financially embarrassed, he can sell for full value
and thus relieve himself. If there is danger of foreclosure,
a sale can be readily effected, and thus all danger of loss
be averted. The idea in buying a lot is to get one which can
be readily sold. This is an important matter.</p>

<p>In carrying out this principle, one of moderate means will
often buy a lot of higher cost than is apparently justifiable.
However, this may be the best thing for him to do. It may be
good business. If he wishes to borrow money with which to
build, he has a better basis for credit. If he puts his house on
a good lot, there is opportunity of selling it because of its favorable
location, and thus the danger of embarrassment is averted.
One can afford to borrow money to build on a good lot, for the
reason that there is little danger of losing either the lot or the
money. The house and the lot, if it rates well in the public
mind, can be easily sold. The lot should not be selected or the
house built, if its sale is not entirely possible. There are towns
as well as localities in which no one of moderate means can
afford to buy or build. Yet such locations are often selected
because they are cheap, and living is cheap. The fact of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
cheapness is against it. The property is cheap because it is
worth little or nothing. It is cheap because no one can get out
what he puts into it. This may apply to a lot in a particular
town, a particular part of a town, or to property in general in a
county or a State. Thus it is that no one of moderate means
can afford to buy absolutely cheap property.</p>

<p>A young man once went to an architect to advise with him
in regard to the selection of a lot. He said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two lots on a certain street that I can get for
$1,200 each. That is a little more than I want to pay, as even
then I would have to borrow more money than I wish in order
to build my house. One of the best lots I know anything about
is on another street, but I can hardly think of that, for they ask
$1,500 for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the lot,&#8221; said the architect, &#8220;and the $1,500 lot is
the one to buy. The $1,200 lots are of questionable value.
The surrounding conditions are such that their value is not
liable to increase. The $1,500 lot is in the swim; two squares
below, lots cannot be bought for $2,400; in fact, they are not in
the market. They are owned by people who desire to hold
them. In two years you will be reasonably certain to realize at
least twice the difference between the values of the $1,500 and
the $1,200 lots. In one case, the value of the lot is not liable
to increase; it may decrease. In the other instance, there is
reasonable certainty of a large increase within a short time. It
is on the edge of high values.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall have to borrow so much money with which to
build, if I take the high-priced lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it? Say your house is going to cost you $3,000.
You say you have $2,800 in cash. In one instance you would
have to borrow $1,400, and in the other $1,700. You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
running much less risk in borrowing $1,700 than you are in
borrowing $1,400. If you had to sell, there is a reasonable certainty
that you could always make a profit on your $4,500 investment,
and a very questionable probability as to the $4,200
investment.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are those who do some very remarkable things for
the sake of keeping out of debt, which, in the end, develops
into more loss than would be possible in the case of debt. For
instance, one will buy a lot for $1,500, and put a $1,500 house
on it. In time the value of the lot increases; at the same
time the value of the house decreases. The lot in itself would
be worth more if the house were off it. It is a cheap house
on a good lot. Thus it is that such property is often sold and
the improvements counted as nothing. Again, exactly the other
thing may happen. An expensive house may be built on a
cheap lot. When finished the house is worth much less than
it cost because it is not well located. One cannot expect to
get full value for the lot without moving the house, and altogether
the situation is disagreeable. How much better it
would be, from a business standpoint, not to build at all,
use the money some other way, or borrow enough money
to have the house and lot properly located. In one case
there is positive loss; in the other, a reasonable certainty of
profit.</p>

<p>Another thing for a man of moderate means to bear in mind
in building a house is, that the investments as to the house and
lot should be such that in case of rental the return derived
would pay a fair interest on the investment, and leave a sufficient
margin for taxes and repairs. As long as this condition
exists, there need be no fear of loss through foreclosure. The
sale of the property may become necessary through embarrass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>ment
in business, loss of situation, or illness; but in such a case
the property can either be sold without loss, or it can be rented
at a figure that will pay all fixed charges, which fact in itself establishes
a value above its cost price. If these principles are all
carried out, there is little chance of loss.</p>

<blockquote><p>Since the publication of his &#8220;Convenient Houses&#8221; Mr. Gibson has been abroad, where
he made a careful study of the national architecture of many countries. Mr. Gibson is remarkable
for the skill with which he manages to utilize ordinary waste spaces, to place every
possible convenience in the housekeeper&#8217;s hands; in short, to apply common-sense in an uncommon
manner. No one interested in building a new house, or altering over an old one, could fail
to obtain valuable hints from his books. The volume is sumptuously illustrated, and will be a
delight to all connoisseurs, both of architecture and of book-making.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;A handsome book, copiously illustrated, giving
foreign examples in domestic architecture, a collection
of American house plans, and including a consideration
of materials and details for the benefit of
the artistic house-builder.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Chicago Evening Post.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;A most timely publication, and will find admirers
among amateur builders as well as trained
architects.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Boston Advertiser.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gibson&#8217;s book is something more than an
enunciation of theories. Under the headings &#8216;Some
House Plans&#8217; and &#8216;Materials and Details,&#8217; there
is a practical working out of the architect&#8217;s general
idea. This part of the work is most valuably
suggestive, and the intending house builder
will find it greatly to his interest to consult Mr.
Gibson&#8217;s books. The present volume is one in which
marked utility is combined with great beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Detroit Free Press.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;It would hardly seem possible that a work on
house-building could be such pleasant reading as is
this handsome volume.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Congregationalist.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;His former book met a real need. His present
work is full of wise and practical suggestions as to
securing beauty without sacrificing convenience or
running into extravagance. All about to build or
reconstruct a house will find it helpful.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Indianapolis News.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;This work is a credit to Mr. Gibson and to his
profession. It is a reflection of deep knowledge of
architecture, and of experience in the practice of the
profession. The illustrations are abundant and excellent,
and the whole is a beautiful piece of book-making.
An appropriate cover is designed by
David Gibson.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Literary World.</b></p>

<p>&#8220;The author is an architect of knowledge, ideas,
